The Lorillard spokeswoman said 0 asbestos was used *-1 in `` very modest amounts '' in * making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced *-1 with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold *-3 , the company said 0 *T*-1 .
Among 33 men who *T*-4 worked closely with the substance , 28 *ICH*-1 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than * expected *?* , the researchers said 0 *T*-1 .
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who *T*-5 study asbestos-related diseases , '' said *T*-1 Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears *-1 to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied * in Western industrialized countries , he said 0 *T*-2 .
The plant , which *T*-1 is owned *-4 by Hollingsworth & Vose Co. , was under contract *ICH*-2 with Lorillard * to make the cigarette filters .
The finding probably will support those who *T*-6 argue that the U.S. should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found * in most schools and other buildings , Dr. Talcott said 0 *T*-1 .
The U.S. is one of the few industrialized nations that *T*-7 does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle-like fibers such as crocidolite that *T*-1 are classified *-5 as amphobiles , according to Brooke T. Mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine .
