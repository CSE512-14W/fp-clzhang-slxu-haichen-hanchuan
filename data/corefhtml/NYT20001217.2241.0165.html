<p>Booking Your Ticket : _ Fly nonstop . </p>
<p>The fewer connections <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[0]</b>you</label> make , the lower the chance that <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[1]</b>you</label> will suffer a delay . </p>
<p>_ Pick <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E1"><b>[2]</b>airports</label> with care . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[3]</b>you</label> have to connect , choose <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E2"><b>[4]</b>the least-congested airport</label> possible ; <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E3"><b>[5]</b>some airports , like Chicago O 'Hare and La Guardia in New York</label> , experience chronic delays . </p>
<p>Take into consideration the weather and the season ; <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E7"><b>[6]</b>an airport in the South</label> might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms . </p>
<p>_ Check times between connecting flights . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[7]</b>Airlines</label> often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[8]</b>you</label> miss <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[9]</b>yours</label> . </p>
<p>Assume each leg of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[10]</b>your</label> flight will arrive late , and book connections that allow ample time . </p>
<p>_ Check on-time records . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E10"><b>[11]</b>The Transportation Department</label> requires <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E11"><b>[12]</b>major domestic airlines</label> to make the on-time record for every flight available to <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E12"><b>[13]</b>consumers</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[14]</b>You</label> can check online at www . </p>
<p>dot . </p>
<p>gov/airconsumer . </p>
<p>That site also reports <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E13"><b>[15]</b>each airline</label> 's on-time record for the previous month . </p>
<p>_ Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times . </p>
<p>Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week ; so are major holidays . </p>
<p>Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E14"><b>[16]</b>business travelers</label> . </p>
<p>Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed , because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[17]</b>airline</label> schedules . </p>
<p>_ Use <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E16"><b>[18]</b>smaller airports</label> . </p>
<p>Instead of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E17"><b>[19]</b>Los Angeles International</label> , for example , consider flying into <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E18"><b>[20]</b>Burbank</label> or <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E19"><b>[21]</b>John Wayne Airport in Orange County , Calif.</label> , or use <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E22"><b>[22]</b>Westchester County Airport</label> instead of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E23"><b>[23]</b>JFK</label> in <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E6"><b>[24]</b>New York</label> . </p>
<p>_ Avoid electronic tickets . </p>
<p>Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket , they are not transferable between <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E24"><b>[25]</b>most airlines</label> if <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[26]</b>you</label> need to switch <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[27]</b>carriers</label> because of delays . </p>
<p>_ Watch for labor disruptions . </p>
<p>Check newspapers and Web sites like www . </p>
<p>thenewfoundlandgroup . </p>
<p>com to identify <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E25"><b>[28]</b>airlines experiencing labor strife , which often increases cancellations and delays</label> . </p>
<p>_ Leave a number . </p>
<p>Make sure <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[29]</b>the airline you book with</label> has a phone number at which <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[30]</b>you</label> can be notified of delays or cancellations . </p>
<p>_ Use <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E27"><b>[31]</b>a travel agent</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E27"><b>[32]</b>A good one</label> can be <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E27"><b>[33]</b>a great ally in the event of a problem</label> _ and may save <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[34]</b>you</label> time and money . </p>
<p>Day of Departure : _ Be informed . </p>
<p>Check <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[35]</b>your</label> flight 's status before heading to <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E1"><b>[36]</b>the airport</label> . </p>
<p>Automated telephone services or <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[37]</b>airline</label> Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E31"><b>[38]</b>ticket agents</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E30"><b>[39]</b>The Federal Aviation Administration</label> 's Web site , www . </p>
<p>fly . </p>
<p>faa . </p>
<p>gov , has real-time information on operations at <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E32"><b>[40]</b>the biggest airports</label> . </p>
<p>_ Pack defensively . </p>
<p>Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[41]</b>your</label> carry-on bag . </p>
<p>If traveling with <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E46"><b>[42]</b>an infant</label> , take 24 hours ' worth of diapers and extra formula . </p>
<p>When possible , avoid checking luggage , in case <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[43]</b>you</label> need to switch flights or <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[44]</b>carriers</label> . </p>
<p>Ship <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[45]</b>your</label> gifts ahead . </p>
<p>_ Educate <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[46]</b>yourself</label> . </p>
<p>Find out what <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[47]</b>your airline</label> promises to do for <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E12"><b>[48]</b>passengers</label> in the event of a delay . </p>
<p>Print out a copy of the policy from <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[49]</b>the airline</label> 's Web site , and carry it with <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[50]</b>you</label> _ in case <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E33"><b>[51]</b>the airline representatives</label> need a reminder . </p>
<p>If a Flight Is Delayed : _ Keep <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[52]</b>your</label> cool . </p>
<p>Becoming angry at <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E35"><b>[53]</b>airline personnel</label> is counterproductive . </p>
<p>Sympathy for <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E35"><b>[54]</b>their</label> plight will sometimes produce results . </p>
<p>_ Do n't stand in line . </p>
<p>To get on another flight , it is often more effective to call <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[55]</b>the airline</label> from <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E36"><b>[56]</b>the airport</label> than to wait at <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E37"><b>[57]</b>the ticket counter</label> . </p>
<p>Carry a cell phone ; if delays are widespread , public telephones may be in demand . </p>
<p>_ Check <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E38"><b>[58]</b>the competition</label> . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E39"><b>[59]</b>another airline</label> has seats to <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[60]</b>your</label> destination , ask <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[61]</b>your airline</label> to endorse <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[62]</b>your</label> ticket to the other line . </p>
<p>_ Get what <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[63]</b>you</label> paid for . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[64]</b>you</label> paid full fare or are <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[65]</b>a high-mileage frequent flier</label> , let <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[66]</b>the airline</label> know . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[67]</b>Your</label> odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase , or <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E26"><b>[68]</b>the airline</label> might pay for <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E41"><b>[69]</b>your hotel</label> , if <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[70]</b>you</label> are delayed overnight . </p>
<p>_ Consider driving . </p>
<p>If the last leg of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[71]</b>your</label> flight is a 200-mile hop , renting <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E42"><b>[72]</b>a car</label> might be a better choice than waiting out a delay . </p>
<p>Getting Even : _ Write a letter . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[73]</b>The airlines</label> have pledged to respond to <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E12"><b>[74]</b>consumer</label> complaints within 60 days . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E9"><b>[75]</b>They</label> almost always offer a refund , reimbursement of expenses , a discount on <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[76]</b>your</label> next ticket _ or all three . </p>
<p>Be sure to save the relevant paperwork . </p>
<p>_ Make it a federal case . </p>
<p>Send a copy of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E29"><b>[77]</b>your</label> letter to <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E44"><b>[78]</b>Washington</label> . </p>
