<p>_ Use <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E16">smaller airports</label> . </p>
<p>Instead of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E17">Los Angeles International</label> , for example , consider flying into <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E18">Burbank</label> or <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E19">John Wayne Airport in Orange County , Calif.</label> , or use <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E22">Westchester County Airport</label> instead of <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E23">JFK</label> in <label class="NYT20001217.2241.0165-E6">New York</label> . </p>
