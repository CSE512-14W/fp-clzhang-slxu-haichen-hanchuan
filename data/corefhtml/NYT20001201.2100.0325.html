<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22"><b>[0]</b>TALLAHASSEE , Fla.</label> _ <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41"><b>[3]</b>The Florida Supreme Court</label> rejected an appeal Friday by <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[5]</b>Vice President Al Gore</label> that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41"><b>[6]</b>it</label> begin the immediate manual recount of 14,000 disputed ballots from <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E45"><b>[7]</b>South Florida</label> , forcing <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[8]</b>Gore</label> 's contest of the <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46"><b>[9]</b>presidential</label> election into a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E7"><b>[10]</b>lower-court</label> trial that begins Saturday morning . </p>
<p>An hour later , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41"><b>[12]</b>the state 's highest court</label> dealt another blow to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E1"><b>[13]</b>supporters of Gore in Palm Beach County</label> , refusing to order a new election that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E3"><b>[16]</b>many voters</label> said was necessary because of the confusing nature of the `` butterfly '' ballot . </p>
<p>The day in <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22"><b>[17]</b>Tallahassee</label> was not a complete loss for <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E4"><b>[19]</b>the vice president 's camp</label> , however . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[21]</b>Judge N. Sanders Sauls of Leon County Circuit Court , who is presiding over the contest lawsuit</label> , announced what could be a relatively brisk pace for Saturday 's trial , expressing the hope that it could be concluded in one marathon 12-hour session . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[25]</b>the judge</label> should agree on Saturday to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[26]</b>Gore</label> 's demand that the ballots be counted , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E4"><b>[28]</b>the Democratic team</label> would not be much further behind schedule than if <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41"><b>[29]</b>the Supreme Court</label> had agreed to the appeal . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[30]</b>Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush</label> have vowed to use every argument at <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[33]</b>their</label> disposal to make certain that no ballots are counted , and that the contest lawsuit is dismissed . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[34]</b>they</label> backed away Friday from some earlier plans that could have delayed the trial , including a demand that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E13"><b>[36]</b>three Florida counties</label> send 1.17 million ballots to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22"><b>[37]</b>Tallahassee</label> , in addition to the 1.16 million ballots from <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E14"><b>[40]</b>Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties</label> that finished arriving <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22"><b>[41]</b>here</label> Friday . </p>
<p>Instead , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[43]</b>the Bush lawyers</label> agreed to the proposal by <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[44]</b>Sauls</label> that the ballots in <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E18"><b>[48]</b>Volusia , Broward and Pinellas counties</label> simply be impounded as possible evidence where they are , and not be transported . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[50]</b>Bush 's lawyers</label> also said <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[51]</b>they</label> would not insist that the opening of the trial deal with a series of new issues <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[52]</b>they</label> raised in a brief on Thursday night . </p>
<p>Those issues include whether <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[53]</b>Gore</label> is really <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[54]</b>a candidate entitled to bring a contest lawsuit</label> _ technically , only <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E24"><b>[55]</b>the electors for a candidate</label> are on a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46"><b>[57]</b>presidential</label> ballot _ and whether any <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46"><b>[58]</b>presidential</label> election can truly be contested under <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E40"><b>[59]</b>Florida</label> law . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[61]</b>The Bush team</label> also agreed to call <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E26"><b>[62]</b>no more than 20 witnesses</label> at the trial , not <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E27"><b>[63]</b>the 93</label> named in a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E28"><b>[64]</b>witness</label> list submitted Thursday night . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E29"><b>[66]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> plan to call <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E30"><b>[67]</b>two witnesses</label> . </p>
<p>The willingness of <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[69]</b>the Bush team</label> to pare down <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10"><b>[70]</b>its</label> demands may have come from the realization that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[71]</b>Sauls</label> was not going to allow any obvious delay tactics in the trial . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[72]</b>The judge</label> said <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[73]</b>he</label> understood why <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23"><b>[74]</b>Gore</label> needed to accelerate the process ; if the trial , the vote-counting and any subsequent appeals extend beyond Dec. 12 , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E31"><b>[76]</b>the Florida Legislature</label> will send <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E32"><b>[78]</b>Bush 's electors</label> to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E33"><b>[79]</b>the Electoral College</label> and the contest lawsuit will likely become moot . </p>
<p>At a preliminary hearing Friday afternoon , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[80]</b>Sauls</label> made it clear <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[81]</b>he</label> would take a no-nonsense approach to the trial . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E34"><b>[82]</b>Lawyers for the various parties to the suit</label> would not be allowed to repeat arguments already made , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5"><b>[84]</b>he</label> said , an important consideration because there are <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E36"><b>[85]</b>multiple defendants in the suit</label> : <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E11"><b>[86]</b>Bush</label> ; <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E37"><b>[87]</b>Katherine Harris</label> , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E37"><b>[89]</b>the Florida secretary of state</label> ; and <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E39"><b>[91]</b>the election boards of three counties</label> . </p>
