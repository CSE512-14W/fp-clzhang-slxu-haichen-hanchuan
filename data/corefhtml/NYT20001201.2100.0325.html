<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22">TALLAHASSEE , Fla.</label> _ <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41">The Florida Supreme Court</label> rejected an appeal Friday by <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">Vice President Al Gore</label> that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41">it</label> begin the immediate manual recount of 14,000 disputed ballots from <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E45">South Florida</label> , forcing <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">Gore</label> 0027s contest of the <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46">presidential</label> election into a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E7">lower-court</label> trial that begins Saturday morning . </p>
<p>An hour later , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41">the state 0027s highest court</label> dealt another blow to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E1">supporters of Gore in Palm Beach County</label> , refusing to order a new election that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E3">many voters</label> said was necessary because of the confusing nature of the `` butterfly 00270027 ballot . </p>
<p>The day in <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22">Tallahassee</label> was not a complete loss for <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E4">the vice president 0027s camp</label> , however . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">Judge N. Sanders Sauls of Leon County Circuit Court , who is presiding over the contest lawsuit</label> , announced what could be a relatively brisk pace for Saturday 0027s trial , expressing the hope that it could be concluded in one marathon 12-hour session . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">the judge</label> should agree on Saturday to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">Gore</label> 0027s demand that the ballots be counted , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E4">the Democratic team</label> would not be much further behind schedule than if <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E41">the Supreme Court</label> had agreed to the appeal . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">Lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush</label> have vowed to use every argument at <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">their</label> disposal to make certain that no ballots are counted , and that the contest lawsuit is dismissed . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">they</label> backed away Friday from some earlier plans that could have delayed the trial , including a demand that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E13">three Florida counties</label> send 1.17 million ballots to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22">Tallahassee</label> , in addition to the 1.16 million ballots from <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E14">Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties</label> that finished arriving <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E22">here</label> Friday . </p>
<p>Instead , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">the Bush lawyers</label> agreed to the proposal by <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">Sauls</label> that the ballots in <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E18">Volusia , Broward and Pinellas counties</label> simply be impounded as possible evidence where they are , and not be transported . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">Bush 0027s lawyers</label> also said <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">they</label> would not insist that the opening of the trial deal with a series of new issues <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">they</label> raised in a brief on Thursday night . </p>
<p>Those issues include whether <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">Gore</label> is really <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">a candidate entitled to bring a contest lawsuit</label> _ technically , only <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E24">the electors for a candidate</label> are on a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46">presidential</label> ballot _ and whether any <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E46">presidential</label> election can truly be contested under <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E40">Florida</label> law . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">The Bush team</label> also agreed to call <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E26">no more than 20 witnesses</label> at the trial , not <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E27">the 93</label> named in a <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E28">witness</label> list submitted Thursday night . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E29">Gore 0027s lawyers</label> plan to call <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E30">two witnesses</label> . </p>
<p>The willingness of <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">the Bush team</label> to pare down <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E10">its</label> demands may have come from the realization that <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">Sauls</label> was not going to allow any obvious delay tactics in the trial . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">The judge</label> said <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">he</label> understood why <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E23">Gore</label> needed to accelerate the process ; if the trial , the vote-counting and any subsequent appeals extend beyond Dec. 12 , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E31">the Florida Legislature</label> will send <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E32">Bush 0027s electors</label> to <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E33">the Electoral College</label> and the contest lawsuit will likely become moot . </p>
<p>At a preliminary hearing Friday afternoon , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">Sauls</label> made it clear <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">he</label> would take a no-nonsense approach to the trial . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E34">Lawyers for the various parties to the suit</label> would not be allowed to repeat arguments already made , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E5">he</label> said , an important consideration because there are <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E36">multiple defendants in the suit</label> : <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E11">Bush</label> ; <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E37">Katherine Harris</label> , <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E37">the Florida secretary of state</label> ; and <label class="NYT20001201.2100.0325-E39">the election boards of three counties</label> . </p>
