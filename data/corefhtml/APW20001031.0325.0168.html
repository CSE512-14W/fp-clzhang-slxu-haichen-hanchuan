<p>Japan 's Central Bank Expects Growth </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E11">TOKYO</label> <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E12">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">Japan 's central bank</label> on Tuesday forecast strong economic growth of between 1.9 percent and 2.3 percent for the current fiscal year _ a prediction far more optimistic than <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">the government</label> 's expectations . </p>
<p>In a wide-ranging report on the outlook for the troubled economy , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2">the Bank of Japan policy board</label> said <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">the country</label> would continue a gradual private demand-led recovery over this year and next . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">The bank</label> said , however , that the `` pace of recovery in personal consumption will be slow '' because it will take time for the improvement in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E17">the corporate sector</label> to filter through to <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E18">the household sector</label> . </p>
<p>Despite those reservations , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">the BOJ</label> 's outlook for the fiscal year ending next March 31 was far rosier than <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">the government</label> 's . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E19">The Economic Planning Agency</label> has forecast growth in gross domestic product at 1.5 percent . </p>
<p>The optimistic report comes as <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">Japan</label> is struggling to emerge from <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">its</label> worst economic downturn since World War II. The economy is beginning to grow , but private demand is lagging behind the corporate recovery . </p>
<p>Unemployment continues to be a problem . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">The government</label> announced on Tuesday that the jobless rate had edged up to 4.7 percent in September . </p>
<p>The rate was at 4.6 percent in August , after hitting a postwar record high of 4.9 percent in February . </p>
<p>In <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">its</label> report Tuesday , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">the BOJ</label> predicted that corporate capital investment will increase over the next 12 months , especially in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E20">information and communications-related sectors</label> . </p>
<p>The forecast also included projections on prices . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">The BOJ</label> said the core consumer price index , which excludes fresh food prices , would fall from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent . </p>
<p>The forecasts reflected a range of opinion among <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E1">the board members</label> , with the lowest and highest predictions excluded . </p>
<p>Despite the strong growth forecast , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3">the BOJ</label> said problems still lingered in the economy . </p>
<p>Slow spending , coupled with structural problems such as corporate restructuring and balance sheet problems , will mean `` the expansion of the economy is unlikely to be vigorous '' <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2">the BOJ board</label> noted . </p>
<p>Higher oil prices were another problem . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2">The BOJ board</label> said that while they wo n't have much direct impact on the <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">Japanese</label> economy for the time being , they could give rise to inflation in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E6">other countries</label> , potentially affecting <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5">Japan</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2">The board</label> said that while restructuring at <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E7">companies</label> and <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E8">financial institutions</label> might `` lay the foundation for economic growth over the medium to long term , '' in the short term such moves could `` further adversely affect the economy . </p>
<p>'' In <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E9">the financial sector</label> , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2">the board</label> said that <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E10">bank</label> lending was expected to stay sluggish . </p>
