<p>Japan 's Central Bank Expects Growth </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E11"><b>[0]</b>TOKYO</label> <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E12"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[2]</b>Japan 's central bank</label> on Tuesday forecast strong economic growth of between 1.9 percent and 2.3 percent for the current fiscal year _ a prediction far more optimistic than <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[3]</b>the government</label> 's expectations . </p>
<p>In a wide-ranging report on the outlook for the troubled economy , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2"><b>[4]</b>the Bank of Japan policy board</label> said <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[5]</b>the country</label> would continue a gradual private demand-led recovery over this year and next . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[6]</b>The bank</label> said , however , that the `` pace of recovery in personal consumption will be slow '' because it will take time for the improvement in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E17"><b>[7]</b>the corporate sector</label> to filter through to <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E18"><b>[8]</b>the household sector</label> . </p>
<p>Despite those reservations , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[9]</b>the BOJ</label> 's outlook for the fiscal year ending next March 31 was far rosier than <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[10]</b>the government</label> 's . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E19"><b>[11]</b>The Economic Planning Agency</label> has forecast growth in gross domestic product at 1.5 percent . </p>
<p>The optimistic report comes as <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[12]</b>Japan</label> is struggling to emerge from <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[13]</b>its</label> worst economic downturn since World War II. The economy is beginning to grow , but private demand is lagging behind the corporate recovery . </p>
<p>Unemployment continues to be a problem . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[14]</b>The government</label> announced on Tuesday that the jobless rate had edged up to 4.7 percent in September . </p>
<p>The rate was at 4.6 percent in August , after hitting a postwar record high of 4.9 percent in February . </p>
<p>In <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[15]</b>its</label> report Tuesday , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[16]</b>the BOJ</label> predicted that corporate capital investment will increase over the next 12 months , especially in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E20"><b>[17]</b>information and communications-related sectors</label> . </p>
<p>The forecast also included projections on prices . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[18]</b>The BOJ</label> said the core consumer price index , which excludes fresh food prices , would fall from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent . </p>
<p>The forecasts reflected a range of opinion among <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E1"><b>[19]</b>the board members</label> , with the lowest and highest predictions excluded . </p>
<p>Despite the strong growth forecast , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E3"><b>[20]</b>the BOJ</label> said problems still lingered in the economy . </p>
<p>Slow spending , coupled with structural problems such as corporate restructuring and balance sheet problems , will mean `` the expansion of the economy is unlikely to be vigorous '' <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2"><b>[21]</b>the BOJ board</label> noted . </p>
<p>Higher oil prices were another problem . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2"><b>[22]</b>The BOJ board</label> said that while they wo n't have much direct impact on the <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[23]</b>Japanese</label> economy for the time being , they could give rise to inflation in <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E6"><b>[24]</b>other countries</label> , potentially affecting <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E5"><b>[25]</b>Japan</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2"><b>[26]</b>The board</label> said that while restructuring at <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E7"><b>[27]</b>companies</label> and <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E8"><b>[28]</b>financial institutions</label> might `` lay the foundation for economic growth over the medium to long term , '' in the short term such moves could `` further adversely affect the economy . </p>
<p>'' In <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E9"><b>[29]</b>the financial sector</label> , <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E2"><b>[30]</b>the board</label> said that <label class="APW20001031.0325.0168-E10"><b>[31]</b>bank</label> lending was expected to stay sluggish . </p>
