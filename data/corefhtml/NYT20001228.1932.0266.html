<p><label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E20">MIAMI</label> _ Seeking to mend tattered relations with <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E2">his opposition</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E31">the international community</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Haiti 0027s president-elect</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Jean-Bertrand Aristide</label> , has assured <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E16">President Clinton</label> that <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">he</label> is committed to a broad range of governmental and political reforms , including a runoff for 10 contested <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E36">Senate</label> seats that had caused an electoral crisis . </p>
<p>In a letter sent to <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E16">Clinton</label> on Wednesday and made public by <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E19">the White House</label> on Thursday , <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Aristide</label> also said <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">he</label> would include <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E1">opposition members</label> in <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E21">his government</label> , consult with <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E1">them</label> in establishing <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E3">an electoral council</label> and let <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E4">the Organization of American States</label> monitor the <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E27">human</label> rights situation . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E5">Opposition groups , which had boycotted the November election</label> , recently vowed to set up <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E6">a parallel government</label> to press <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Aristide</label> after <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">his</label> inauguration on Feb. 7. The letter appears to be an attempt not only to calm the concerns of <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E19">the current American administration</label> , but also to reach out to <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E8">the next one</label> . </p>
<p>In it , <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">the Haitian president-elect</label> addressed a total of eight points discussed last week with <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E10">an American delegation led by a special envoy , Anthony Lake</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">I</label> confirm <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">my</label> commitment to the points made therein , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Aristide</label> said in the letter , `` confident that they will help strengthen the ties between <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E13">our two nations where democracy and peace will flourish</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Since 1994 , when <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E19">it</label> sent <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E15">20,000 troops</label> to restore <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Aristide</label> to power after <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">he</label> was toppled in a coup , <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E19">the Clinton administration</label> has sought to bolster democracy in <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E9">Haiti</label> . </p>
<p>But more recently <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E7">the United States</label> has withheld direct aid , conditioning its resumption on free and fair elections and progress in the fight against the drug trade . </p>
<p>Describing the letter as `` a real opening , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E18">a senior Clinton administration official</label> said : `` It 0027s up to <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E2">the opposition</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E21">the new administration</label> whether or not <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E21">they</label> wish to pursue it . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E18">I</label> hope <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E21">they</label> do , because <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E18">I</label> do not see a good alternative . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E22">Another administration official</label> said the talks last week involved no quid pro quo , although <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E13">all sides</label> knew that a resolution of <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E9">Haiti</label> 0027s political quagmire could result in the release of hundreds of millions of dollars in desperately needed aid . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E18">I</label> think <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">Aristide</label> is aware <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">he</label> has got <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E8">a skeptical administration</label> coming into <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E23">Washington</label> and sees the need to mend fences and to at least commit to some significant things , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E22">the official</label> said . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E30">he</label> follows through , they are very significant . </p>
<p>00270027 The biggest stumbling block to normal relations with <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E7">the United States</label> has been the controversy over the May 21 <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E28">legislative</label> and local elections . </p>
<p>Ten <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E36">Senate</label> seats were awarded to <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E24">candidates of Aristide 0027s Lavalas party</label> through a vote counting method later discredited by <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E31">the international community</label> . </p>
<p>The method gave <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E24">the Lavalas candidates</label> a first-round victory even though <label class="NYT20001228.1932.0266-E24">the candidates</label> had failed to win an outright majority . </p>
