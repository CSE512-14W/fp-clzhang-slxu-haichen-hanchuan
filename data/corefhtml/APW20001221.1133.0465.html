<p>The report provides further evidence that <label class="APW20001221.1133.0465-E3"><b>[4]</b>America</label> 's boom times are definitely over . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001221.1133.0465-E5"><b>[5]</b>The Commerce Department</label> said the third quarter increase in the gross domestic product _ the economy 's total output of goods and services _ was even weaker than previously believed as the trade deficit deteriorated further . </p>
