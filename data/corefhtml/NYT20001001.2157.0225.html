<p>EDITORIAL : ISSUES FOR THE SUPREME COURT </p>
<p>& UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E19"><b>[0]</b>The New York Times</label> said in an editorial on Monday , Oct. 2 : The new <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[1]</b>Supreme Court</label> term , which opens today , has no high-profile cases to match last session 's tangles over partial birth abortion , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E21"><b>[2]</b>gays</label> in <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E22"><b>[3]</b>the Boy Scouts</label> and organized prayer at <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E23"><b>[4]</b>high school</label> football games . </p>
<p>But even shorn of the <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E24"><b>[5]</b>Microsoft</label> case , this season will not lack for suspense or importance . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[6]</b>The court</label> 's docket includes cases that , depending on their outcome , could significantly bolster or weaken environmental protection , federal civil rights , freedom of the press and the Fourth Amendment 's shield against unreasonable searches and seizures . </p>
<p>Once again , a prime battleground will be the constitutional allocation of power _ between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E26"><b>[7]</b>the federal government</label> and <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E27"><b>[8]</b>the states</label> , and between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29"><b>[9]</b>Congress</label> and <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E28"><b>[10]</b>federal regulatory agencies</label> . </p>
<p>Last term , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[11]</b>the court</label> lengthened its string of regrettable 5-to-4 decisions trimming federal authority by striking down portions of the Violence Against Women Act and the federal law barring age discrimination in employment . </p>
<p>A case to be heard next week tests whether the majority 's constricted view of federal power extends to shielding <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E30"><b>[12]</b>states</label> from lawsuits brought by <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E31"><b>[14]</b>their public employees</label> under the Americans With Disabilities Act. In another big federalism case with implications for the environment , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[15]</b>the court</label> will consider whether <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29"><b>[16]</b>Congress</label> exceeded its Commerce Clause powers by allowing regulation of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E1"><b>[17]</b>small , intrastate wetlands</label> to protect <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E2"><b>[18]</b>the habitats of migratory birds</label> . </p>
<p>This term <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[19]</b>the court</label> will also weigh a challenge to the authority of the <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3"><b>[20]</b>Environmental Protection Agency</label> to set national standards for air pollutants . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E4"><b>[21]</b>The justices</label> should resist this invitation to disrupt the modern regulatory system by overturning <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29"><b>[22]</b>Congress</label> ' broad delegation of authority to <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3"><b>[23]</b>the EPA</label> or otherwise diluting <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3"><b>[24]</b>the agency</label> 's power to set `` uncompromising '' health-based standards . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[25]</b>the court</label> begins the term 's review of Fourth Amendment principles with an <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E5"><b>[26]</b>Indianapolis</label> case involving the use of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E6"><b>[27]</b>police</label> checkpoints and drug-sniffing dogs to check <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E7"><b>[28]</b>motorists</label> for illicit drugs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[29]</b>The court</label> should view these law enforcement stops as an overly aggressive leap from the sobriety checkpoints it has previously approved to remove an immediate safety hazard . </p>
<p>Then , on Wednesday , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[30]</b>the court</label> will consider the outrageous privacy violation committed against <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E8"><b>[31]</b>pregnant women who were selectively tested for cocaine use while seeking prenatal care at a South Carolina hospital , and subsequently arrested or threatened with arrest</label> . </p>
<p>Amicus briefs from <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E11"><b>[35]</b>leading medical and health groups</label> caution that such punitive policies will drive <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E12"><b>[36]</b>women</label> away from critically needed prenatal care and treatment programs . </p>
<p>Later this term , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[37]</b>the court</label> will confront a major media case . </p>
<p>At issue is the liability of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13"><b>[39]</b>a Pennsylvania radio station</label> under the federal wiretap statute for broadcasting an illegally taped cell phone conversation between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E15"><b>[41]</b>two union officials</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E18"><b>[42]</b>No one</label> accuses <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13"><b>[43]</b>the station</label> of involvement in the taping , which was done by <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E16"><b>[44]</b>an anonymous third party</label> . </p>
<p>Should <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20"><b>[45]</b>the court</label> override <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13"><b>[46]</b>the station</label> 's First Amendment privilege here , the chilling impact on newsgathering cannot be overstated , much as <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E19"><b>[47]</b>The Times</label> intends to argue in an amicus brief . </p>
