<p>EDITORIAL : ISSUES FOR THE SUPREME COURT </p>
<p>& UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E19">The New York Times</label> said in an editorial on Monday , Oct. 2 : The new <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">Supreme Court</label> term , which opens today , has no high-profile cases to match last session 's tangles over partial birth abortion , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E21">gays</label> in <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E22">the Boy Scouts</label> and organized prayer at <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E23">high school</label> football games . </p>
<p>But even shorn of the <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E24">Microsoft</label> case , this season will not lack for suspense or importance . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">The court</label> 's docket includes cases that , depending on their outcome , could significantly bolster or weaken environmental protection , federal civil rights , freedom of the press and the Fourth Amendment 's shield against unreasonable searches and seizures . </p>
<p>Once again , a prime battleground will be the constitutional allocation of power _ between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E26">the federal government</label> and <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E27">the states</label> , and between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29">Congress</label> and <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E28">federal regulatory agencies</label> . </p>
<p>Last term , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> lengthened its string of regrettable 5-to-4 decisions trimming federal authority by striking down portions of the Violence Against Women Act and the federal law barring age discrimination in employment . </p>
<p>A case to be heard next week tests whether the majority 's constricted view of federal power extends to shielding <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E30">states</label> from lawsuits brought by <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E31">their public employees</label> under the Americans With Disabilities Act. In another big federalism case with implications for the environment , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> will consider whether <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29">Congress</label> exceeded its Commerce Clause powers by allowing regulation of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E1">small , intrastate wetlands</label> to protect <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E2">the habitats of migratory birds</label> . </p>
<p>This term <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> will also weigh a challenge to the authority of the <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3">Environmental Protection Agency</label> to set national standards for air pollutants . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E4">The justices</label> should resist this invitation to disrupt the modern regulatory system by overturning <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E29">Congress</label> ' broad delegation of authority to <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3">the EPA</label> or otherwise diluting <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E3">the agency</label> 's power to set `` uncompromising '' health-based standards . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> begins the term 's review of Fourth Amendment principles with an <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E5">Indianapolis</label> case involving the use of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E6">police</label> checkpoints and drug-sniffing dogs to check <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E7">motorists</label> for illicit drugs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">The court</label> should view these law enforcement stops as an overly aggressive leap from the sobriety checkpoints it has previously approved to remove an immediate safety hazard . </p>
<p>Then , on Wednesday , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> will consider the outrageous privacy violation committed against <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E8">pregnant women who were selectively tested for cocaine use while seeking prenatal care at a South Carolina hospital , and subsequently arrested or threatened with arrest</label> . </p>
<p>Amicus briefs from <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E11">leading medical and health groups</label> caution that such punitive policies will drive <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E12">women</label> away from critically needed prenatal care and treatment programs . </p>
<p>Later this term , <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> will confront a major media case . </p>
<p>At issue is the liability of <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13">a Pennsylvania radio station</label> under the federal wiretap statute for broadcasting an illegally taped cell phone conversation between <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E15">two union officials</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E18">No one</label> accuses <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13">the station</label> of involvement in the taping , which was done by <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E16">an anonymous third party</label> . </p>
<p>Should <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E20">the court</label> override <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E13">the station</label> 's First Amendment privilege here , the chilling impact on newsgathering cannot be overstated , much as <label class="NYT20001001.2157.0225-E19">The Times</label> intends to argue in an amicus brief . </p>
