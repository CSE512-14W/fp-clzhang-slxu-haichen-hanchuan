<p>All told , that racked up a $ 1 billion for Europe 0027s $ 10 billion music industry last year , and cost <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E15">EU governments</label> around $ 72 million in lost tax revenues , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E12">the group</label> says . </p>
<p>Several lawsuits have been filed around <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E16">the world</label> , including an ongoing lawsuit <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E17">a number of record companies</label> have brought against <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E18">Napster Inc. , whose software allows users to easily swap music files</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19">GEMA</label> , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19">German 0027s main licensing group</label> , targeted <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">Hewlett-Packard</label> as <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">a test case</label> in May , reasoning that <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">the company</label> leads <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">the German market leader in CD burners</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">Hewlett-Packard</label> dug in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">its</label> heels when <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">it</label> was ordered to pay 30 marks ( $ 12.90 ) for each CD burner sold in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34">Germany</label> since February 1998 . </p>
<p>The legal battle continued until Thursday , when an agreement was reached to have <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">Hewlett-Packard</label> pay 3.60 marks ( $ 1.54 ) for each unit sold during that period while agreeing to pay 12 marks ( $ 5.16 ) for each one sold in the future . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25">Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman Jeannette Weisschuh</label> refused to say how much that would set <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">the company</label> back . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25">she</label> criticized the settlement for putting <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">Hewlett-Packard</label> at a disadvantage against <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E27">foreign online retailers who , unburdened by such fees , can sell cheaper CD burners</label> . </p>
<p>`` This was a trial to set an example for the whole market , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25">Weisschuh</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s unfair to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E28">the consumers who have to pay more</label> and unfair to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45">the manufacturers</label> because it gives <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45">us</label> a competitive disadvantage . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E29">Other companies selling CD burners in Germany</label> will also be subject to the fees , which could vary depending on what kind of agreement <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E29">they</label> reach with <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19">GEMA</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21">Hewlett-Packard</label> settlement is expected to set a benchmark , however . </p>
<p>Currently , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45">equipment manufacturers</label> pay 2.50 marks ( $ 1.07 ) for each cassette recorder and 18 marks ( $ 7.74 ) for each video recorder sold in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34">Germany</label> . </p>
<p>The fees , which are not collected by <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34">the government</label> , are distributed by <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19">GEMA</label> to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E30">copyright owners</label> through <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E31">recording houses</label> and <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E32">music distributors</label> . </p>
