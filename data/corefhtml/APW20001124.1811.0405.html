<p>Hewlett-Packard To Pay German Fees </p>
<p><label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E23"><b>[0]</b>FRANKFURT , Germany</label> <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E35"><b>[2]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[4]</b>Computer giant Hewlett-Packard Corp.</label> has become <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[5]</b>the first company to be snagged by a German law requiring firms to pay fees for making CD burners that are being used to illegally lift the latest hits off the World Wide Web</label> . </p>
<p>The case sets the stage for <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E41"><b>[9]</b>other European countries</label> to possibly adopt similar rules to stem an epidemic that cost <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E43"><b>[10]</b>the music industry</label> an estimated $ 5 billion last year . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E44"><b>[11]</b>analysts</label> blasted the agreement reached Thursday as another example of <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[12]</b>Germany</label> 's notorious thatch of regulations . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45"><b>[13]</b>The manufacturers</label> are <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45"><b>[14]</b>scapegoats</label> , '' said <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E1"><b>[15]</b>Robert Labatt</label> , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E1"><b>[16]</b>a new media analyst at research group Gartner</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 's the individual works of art , books , songs , videos , that need to be protected . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E5"><b>[19]</b>Many of Germany 's neighbors , including France , Italy and Greece</label> , have similar laws meant to protect <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E10"><b>[25]</b>authors</label> and <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E11"><b>[26]</b>musicians</label> by nailing <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E33"><b>[27]</b>makers of equipment used to violate copyright laws</label> . </p>
<p>But the laws date back decades and focus on devices like tape recorders and video players . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[28]</b>German</label> case against <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[29]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> extends <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[30]</b>Germany</label> 's pre-existing law into the digital age , when such things as CD burners , computer printers , hard drives and high-speed modems make it easier to copy and transfer copyrighted items . </p>
<p>According to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E12"><b>[31]</b>the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry</label> , about 500 million CDs are pirated annually by <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E13"><b>[32]</b>people creating their own CDs from downloaded tunes off the Internet</label> . </p>
<p>More than 25 million pirated music files are available online , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E12"><b>[34]</b>the group</label> estimates . </p>
<p>All told , that racked up a $ 1 billion for Europe 's $ 10 billion music industry last year , and cost <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E15"><b>[36]</b>EU governments</label> around $ 72 million in lost tax revenues , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E12"><b>[37]</b>the group</label> says . </p>
<p>Several lawsuits have been filed around <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E16"><b>[38]</b>the world</label> , including an ongoing lawsuit <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E17"><b>[39]</b>a number of record companies</label> have brought against <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E18"><b>[40]</b>Napster Inc. , whose software allows users to easily swap music files</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19"><b>[42]</b>GEMA</label> , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19"><b>[44]</b>German 's main licensing group</label> , targeted <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[45]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> as <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[46]</b>a test case</label> in May , reasoning that <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[47]</b>the company</label> leads <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[49]</b>the German market leader in CD burners</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[50]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> dug in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[51]</b>its</label> heels when <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[52]</b>it</label> was ordered to pay 30 marks ( $ 12.90 ) for each CD burner sold in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[53]</b>Germany</label> since February 1998 . </p>
<p>The legal battle continued until Thursday , when an agreement was reached to have <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[54]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> pay 3.60 marks ( $ 1.54 ) for each unit sold during that period while agreeing to pay 12 marks ( $ 5.16 ) for each one sold in the future . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25"><b>[57]</b>Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman Jeannette Weisschuh</label> refused to say how much that would set <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[58]</b>the company</label> back . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25"><b>[59]</b>she</label> criticized the settlement for putting <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[60]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> at a disadvantage against <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E27"><b>[61]</b>foreign online retailers who , unburdened by such fees , can sell cheaper CD burners</label> . </p>
<p>`` This was a trial to set an example for the whole market , '' said <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E25"><b>[63]</b>Weisschuh</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 's unfair to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E28"><b>[64]</b>the consumers who have to pay more</label> and unfair to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45"><b>[66]</b>the manufacturers</label> because it gives <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45"><b>[67]</b>us</label> a competitive disadvantage . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E29"><b>[68]</b>Other companies selling CD burners in Germany</label> will also be subject to the fees , which could vary depending on what kind of agreement <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E29"><b>[70]</b>they</label> reach with <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19"><b>[71]</b>GEMA</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E21"><b>[72]</b>Hewlett-Packard</label> settlement is expected to set a benchmark , however . </p>
<p>Currently , <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E45"><b>[73]</b>equipment manufacturers</label> pay 2.50 marks ( $ 1.07 ) for each cassette recorder and 18 marks ( $ 7.74 ) for each video recorder sold in <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[74]</b>Germany</label> . </p>
<p>The fees , which are not collected by <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E34"><b>[75]</b>the government</label> , are distributed by <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E19"><b>[76]</b>GEMA</label> to <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E30"><b>[77]</b>copyright owners</label> through <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E31"><b>[78]</b>recording houses</label> and <label class="APW20001124.1811.0405-E32"><b>[79]</b>music distributors</label> . </p>
