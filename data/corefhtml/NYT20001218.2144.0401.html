<p>LVMH MAKES A TWO-PART OFFER FOR DONNA KARAN </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[1]</b>The fashion house of Donna Karan , which has long struggled to achieve financial equilibrium</label> , has finally found <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[3]</b>a potential buyer</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[4]</b>The giant luxury conglomerate LVMH-Moet</label> Hennessy Louis Vuitton , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[6]</b>which</label> has been on a sustained acquisition bid , has offered to acquire <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[7]</b>Donna Karan International</label> for $ 195 million in a cash deal with the idea that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[8]</b>it</label> could expand <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[9]</b>the company</label> 's revenues and beef up accessories and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E2"><b>[10]</b>overseas</label> sales . </p>
<p>At $ 8.50 a share , the <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[11]</b>LVMH</label> offer represents a premium of nearly 75 percent to the closing stock price on Friday . </p>
<p>Still , it is significantly less than the $ 24 a share at which <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[12]</b>the company</label> went public in 1996 . </p>
<p>The final price is also less than one-third of <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[13]</b>the company</label> 's annual revenue of $ 662 million , a significantly smaller multiple than <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E3"><b>[15]</b>European luxury fashion houses like Fendi</label> were receiving last year . </p>
<p>The deal is still subject to <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E31"><b>[17]</b>board</label> approval , but in a related move that will surely help pave the way , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[18]</b>LVMH</label> purchased <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[19]</b>Gabrielle Studio</label> , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[20]</b>the company held by the designer and her husband , Stephan Weiss , that holds all of the Donna Karan trademarks</label> , for $ 450 million . </p>
<p>That price would be reduced by as much as $ 50 million if <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[27]</b>LVMH</label> enters into an agreement to acquire <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[28]</b>DKI</label> within one year . </p>
<p>In a press release , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[29]</b>LVMH</label> said <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[30]</b>it</label> aimed to combine <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[31]</b>Gabrielle</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[32]</b>Donna Karan International</label> and that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[33]</b>it</label> expected that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[34]</b>Karan</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E9"><b>[36]</b>her husband</label> `` will exchange a significant portion of their <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[37]</b>DKI</label> shares for , and purchase additional stock in , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E32"><b>[38]</b>the combined entity</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[39]</b>Karan , who will stay on as chief designer and creative leader for the design studio</label> , called the decision to sell <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[44]</b>Gabrielle</label> and possibly <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[46]</b>her namesake design studio</label> , of <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[47]</b>which</label> <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[48]</b>she</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E9"><b>[49]</b>Weiss</label> still own about 22 percent , as very emotional . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[50]</b>She</label> added , `` Yes , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[51]</b>I</label> am extraordinarily tied to it , but after lengthy discussions <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[52]</b>I</label> believe with all <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[53]</b>my</label> heart that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[54]</b>LVMH</label> has the expertise , resources , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E33"><b>[55]</b>global</label> scale and , most importantly , the vision , to make this the luxury goods brand that was always <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[56]</b>our</label> dream . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[57]</b>Karan</label> also expressed satisfaction that the <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[59]</b>Paris-based LVMH , which like many European acquirers has been largely indifferent to established American design houses</label> , was interested in purchasing <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[65]</b>hers</label> . </p>
<p>`` It is very flattering that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[66]</b>they</label> realize the value of the trademarks , '' <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[67]</b>she</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E13"><b>[68]</b>Investors</label> reacted enthusiastically , sending the stock up $ 3.63 to $ 8.50 . </p>
<p>`` Ultimately , for <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[69]</b>them</label> , acquisition is the best route to go , '' said <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E14"><b>[70]</b>Harvey Robinson</label> , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E14"><b>[71]</b>an apparel analyst with the Chapman Co. , a Baltimore-based investment bank and brokerage firm</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E16"><b>[76]</b>We</label> think <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[77]</b>LVMH</label> is getting a well-recognized brand with lots of cachet and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E16"><b>[78]</b>we</label> believe <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[79]</b>they</label> will be able to maximize on the acquisition . </p>
<p>'' Since <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[80]</b>Donna Karan International</label> went public in 1996 , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[81]</b>its</label> stock has been a favorite whipping boy of <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E19"><b>[82]</b>Wall Street</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E13"><b>[83]</b>Investors</label> grumbled over what <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E13"><b>[84]</b>they</label> saw as excessive and uncontrolled spending as <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[85]</b>Karan , who acted as chief designer as well as chief executive</label> , spent heavily on foreign travel for <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E35"><b>[89]</b>a large retinue</label> and for expensive swaths of fabric , only a tiny fraction of which were used for <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[90]</b>her</label> collection . </p>
<p>As expenses ballooned , sales stumbled , leaving the <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[91]</b>Donna Karan International</label> initial public offering as one of the greatest disasters of the year . </p>
<p>In 1997 , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[92]</b>the company</label> hired <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E20"><b>[93]</b>John D. Idol</label> to take over as <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E20"><b>[94]</b>chief executive</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E20"><b>[95]</b>Idol</label> was able to increase revenue by signing copious licensing agreements and cutting some expenses . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[96]</b>The company</label> estimates earnings per share will be 66 cents for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31 , compared with a loss of $ 3.78 a share in the year <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E20"><b>[97]</b>he</label> took the job . </p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E20"><b>[98]</b>Idol</label> if <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[99]</b>Donna Karan International</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[100]</b>Gabrielle</label> merge . </p>
<p>Despite the apparent financial improvement , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E13"><b>[101]</b>investors</label> have continued to shun <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[102]</b>the company</label> largely because of <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[103]</b>Karan</label> 's separate deal with <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[104]</b>Gabrielle studio</label> , which many felt was overly indulgent considering <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[105]</b>the company</label> 's financial performance . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[106]</b>That company , privately owned by Karan and Weiss</label> , collects a royalty of 1.75 percent of the first $ 250 million of net sales a year , rising to 3.5 percent of sales that exceed $ 1.5 billion . </p>
<p>Last year , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[109]</b>Donna Karan International</label> paid <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[110]</b>Karan</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E9"><b>[111]</b>Weiss</label> $ 25 million in a year that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[112]</b>the design house</label> made only $ 10 million in profit . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[113]</b>LVMH</label> succeeds in acquiring <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[114]</b>Donna Karan International</label> and combines <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[115]</b>it</label> with <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E6"><b>[116]</b>Gabrielle</label> , the royalty arrangement would be moot . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E21"><b>[117]</b>several industry insiders</label> wondered whether <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E38"><b>[118]</b>LVMH</label> is getting such a great deal . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[119]</b>Karan</label> 's name is already licensed to a wide array of products , and because it is widely distributed through <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E37"><b>[120]</b>midprice department stores</label> , it lacks the exclusive appeal of names like <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E22"><b>[121]</b>Marc Jacobs</label> and <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E23"><b>[122]</b>Michael Kors</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E24"><b>[123]</b>Myron Ullman</label> , <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E24"><b>[125]</b>LVMH 's managing director</label> , counters that <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E8"><b>[126]</b>Karan</label> has built a `` well-respected <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E33"><b>[127]</b>global</label> brand with opportunities in accessories and to expand <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E27"><b>[128]</b>outside the U.S.</label> '' <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[130]</b>Donna Karan International</label> gets 35 percent of <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E12"><b>[131]</b>its</label> revenues from <label class="NYT20001218.2144.0401-E28"><b>[132]</b>overseas</label> . </p>
