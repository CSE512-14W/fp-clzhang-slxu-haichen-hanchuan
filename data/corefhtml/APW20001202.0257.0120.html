<p><label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E19">Phoenix radio station KMVP</label> reported Friday that <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E7">Smith</label> had quietly been working on a deal with <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E23">TCU coach Dennis Franchione</label> that would have matched the one offered by <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E25">Alabama</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E23">Franchione</label> apparently could n0027t resist the lure of <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E26">one of college football 0027s most storied programs</label> . </p>
<p>While most of the recent speculation centered on <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E10">Koetter</label> , there was pressure from <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E29">some Arizona State boosters</label> to hire <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E30">Danny White</label> , <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E30">the former Arizona State and Dallas Cowboys quarterback who coaches the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E3">Snyder</label> was fired after <label class="APW20001202.0257.0120-E34">his teams</label> went 6-6 last year and 6-5 this season . </p>
