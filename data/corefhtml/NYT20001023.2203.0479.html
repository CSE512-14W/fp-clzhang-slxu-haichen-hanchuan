<p>The latest spots by <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E8">the Bush campaign</label> and <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E10">the Republican Party</label> , meanwhile , take a much softer tack : In fact , two new <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Bush</label> commercials that began running Monday in <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E11">many swing states</label> merely reiterate <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">the governor</label> 0027s thoughts and ideas about education , an issue <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">he</label> has promoted on television since the <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E12">New Hampshire</label> primary . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E13">Parents</label> need tools to help <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E13">them</label> protect and nurture <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E14">their families</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Bush</label> says in one of the new spots . </p>
<p>In the other , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">he</label> says , `` How come the hard things do n0027t get done ? </p>
<p>Because they 0027re hard . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E15">we</label> want to make sure <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E16">no child</label> gets left behind in <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E17">America</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E15">we</label> need the courage to do some tough things . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E96">The Democrats</label> 0027 continuing emphasis on <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Bush</label> 0027s <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E18">home-state</label> record is a reflection of a strategy of attack that has been tried in all recent elections against <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E19">sitting or former governors who secure their party nomination for president</label> . </p>
<p>In the last 25 years , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E21">political analysts</label> say , the tactic has succeeded only once , when <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E22">then-Vice President George Bush</label> famously disparaged <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E24">Michael S. Dukakis</label> 0027 record in <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E26">Massachusetts</label> on pollution in <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E27">Boston Harbor</label> and shortcomings in a <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E26">state</label> <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E29">prison</label> furlough program . </p>
<p>`` Every time <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E30">a governor</label> runs , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E31">the opponent</label> attacks <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E30">his</label> record . </p>
<p>But three out of the last four times , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E30">the governor</label> has won , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E32">Darrell West</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E32">a political science professor at Brown University who analyzes campaign advertising</label> , said of similar attacks faced by <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E35">Jimmy Carter</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E36">Ronald Reagan</label> and <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E37">Bill Clinton</label> . </p>
<p>The sharp critiques issued by <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E38">the Gore campaign</label> and <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E95">its supporters</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E32">West</label> said , have placed <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E96">the Democrats</label> in an unconventional position . </p>
<p>`` There 0027s been a role reversal in this election , because typically <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E40">the challenger</label> goes on attack and <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E41">the incumbent</label> stays above the fray , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E32">he</label> observed . </p>
<p>`` And here <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E42">you</label> have <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E39">Gore</label> playing the <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E44">challenger</label> role . </p>
<p>00270027 In <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E45">its</label> new video , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E45">the Democratic National Committee</label> interviews <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E46">several Texans with complaints about what they say are the Bush administration 0027s neglectful attitudes about their problems</label> . </p>
<p>One segment features <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E48">the destitute hamlets , or colonias , that are home to some of the poorest Texans</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Governor Bush</label> has never visited <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E51">a colonia</label> , so to the extent that that shows how much of a priority it is for <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">him</label> , may <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E17">the American public</label> decide , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E53">a former colonia resident</label> comments . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E8">The Bush campaign</label> took issue with that assertion , declaring in a statement that <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">the governor</label> had visited <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E55">colonias</label> `` three times 00270027 while inspecting flood damage and being briefed on water and sewage problems . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E56">Some of the video 0027s interviewees</label> have been seen on television this year before . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E57">Tamara Maschino</label> , for example , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E57">a resident of the Clear Lake area of Houston</label> , criticizes <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Bush</label> for <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">his</label> lack of attention to pollution problems from <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E62">chemical plants near her home</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E64">We</label> went to <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E65">Governor Bush 0027s office</label> and spoke with <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E66">John Howard</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E66">his top environmental aide</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E57">Maschino</label> says in the video . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E64">We</label> met <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E66">him</label> for over an hour . </p>
<p>Nothing happened . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E57">Maschino</label> also appeared in an attack advertisement broadcast in the spring by <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E68">the Sierra Club</label> , in which similar accusations were leveled . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E69">Joe Andrew</label> , <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E69">national chairman of the Democratic National Committee</label> , said the aim of the video was to personalize the policy differences between <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E7">Bush</label> and <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E39">Vice President Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p>`` It becomes about <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E73">people</label> , not politics , when <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E74">you</label> hear <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E75">the individuals</label> , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E69">Andrew , who traveled to Maine Monday to show the video to reporters and voters at a community center in Portland and on a college campus in Bangor</label> . </p>

<p>`` <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E38">The Gore campaign</label> has been very willing to produce television spots for the purposes of a press release , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001023.2203.0479-E85">he</label> said , adding that it was a fairly economical tool . </p>
