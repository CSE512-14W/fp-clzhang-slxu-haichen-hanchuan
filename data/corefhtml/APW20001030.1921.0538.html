<p>Relations between <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">this sprawling southeast Asian nation</label> have soured in recent months , poisoned in part by bitter exchanges between <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">the U.S. ambassador</label> and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E10">local officials</label> . </p>
<p>The problem has been compounded by anger in <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">the world 0027s most populous Muslim country</label> , over <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">Washington</label> 0027s stance on the <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E13">Israeli-Palestinian</label> violence _ <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E15">many here</label> say <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> has taken <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E13">Israel</label> 0027s side . </p>
<p>Add the factors together , and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E17">U.S. officials</label> do n0027t like what <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E17">they</label> see : <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E17">They</label> have advised <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E18">U.S. citizens in Indonesia</label> to be wary . </p>
<p>On Monday , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E6">the U.S. Embassy</label> condemned what <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E6">it</label> described as `` hostile actions 00270027 that threaten <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">American</label> lives and endanger relations along with trade , investment and tourism : _ Over the weekend , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E21">Islamic militants</label> went to <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E22">hotels in the central Javanese city of Solo</label> , demanding that <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E25">American tourists</label> leave <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">the country</label> within 48 hours . </p>
<p>_ <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E26">The embassy , located across Jakarta 0027s main park from the presidential palace</label> , suspended <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E6">its</label> public functions for at least a week after a series of protests and threats . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E30">Muslim youths</label> recently staged a half dozen rallies in front of <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E26">the embassy</label> to protest <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">Washington</label> 0027s perceived bias in favor of <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E13">Israel</label> . </p>

<p>Just a year ago , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">Washington</label> was offering enthusiastic backing for <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> 0027s nascent democracy . </p>
<p>But in the months since , reform has stalled amid rampant violence , political infighting and scandal . </p>
<p>Sectarian fighting regularly claims lives in <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E37">several Indonesian regions</label> and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E38">pro-Indonesian militias</label> continue to attack <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E39">peacekeepers in East Timor , the territory that gained independence from Indonesia last year</label> . </p>
<p>Such problems have led to growing discord between <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E42">Indonesian officials</label> and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard</label> . </p>

<p>Among other things , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">he</label> has publicly insisted that <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia 0027s government</label> make good on promises to take difficult steps to fix the economy and bring to justice <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E52">those responsible for the bloody destruction of East Timor after the independence vote</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E47">Indonesian lawmakers</label> have been irritated by <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">Gelbard</label> 0027s blunt style : <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E47">They</label> prefer to conduct politics in a polite and non-confrontational way that follows the traditions of <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E24">the main island of Java</label> . </p>
<p>Last week <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E49">some members of a parliamentary committee</label> urged <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">the government</label> to declare <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">Gelbard</label> `` <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E44">persona non grata</label> . </p>

<p>In September , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E65">three of the U.N. workers stationed in East Timor</label> were killed in <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E68">Indonesian-controlled West Timor</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">The United States</label> is seen as <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the driving force behind international pressure on Indonesia</label> in the wake of those deaths , said <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E70">Dewi Fortuna Anwar</label> , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E70">an adviser to Wahid 0027s predecessor , B.J.

<p>`` <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E74">People</label> find it very unfair that <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> harshly criticizes <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> over the deaths of <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E65">three U.N. workers</label> and then does not condemn <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E13">Israel</label> over the deaths of <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E77">more than 100 Palestinians</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E70">she</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E78">Countries going through transition</label> are always more nationalistic and sensitive to outside influences . </p>
<p>But this is also a matter of personality , 00270027 <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E70">Anwar</label> said . </p>
<p>`` What <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">Gelbard</label> has been up to has been the straw that has broken the camel 0027s back . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E2">Gelbard</label> was not available for comment Monday , but in the past has maintained that <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> still strongly supports democratic reforms in <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E70">Anwar</label> and others warn that <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">anti-American</label> sentiment could rise , particularly among <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E79">Wahid 0027s political opponents , who are pressing for his resignation</label> . </p>
<p>`` But just remember , if relations are allowed to deteriorate any further , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">its people</label> have far more to lose than <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> does , 00270027 <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E80">The Jakarta Post</label> said in an editorial Monday . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">The United States</label> gives <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E60">Indonesia</label> millions of dollars in aid and is <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">a major market for the country 0027s exports</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E53">President Wahid</label> initially enjoyed warm relations with <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">the United States</label> . </p>
<p>As <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E53">Indonesia 0027s first democratically chosen head of state in four decades</label> , <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E53">he</label> visited <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E81">Clinton</label> twice at <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E82">the White House</label> , and <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">Washington</label> has been <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E8">a strong supporter of International Monetary Fund aid to Indonesia</label> . </p>
<p>However , relations became strained after <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E53">Wahid</label> 0027s commitment to reform appeared to waver . </p>
<p>They deteriorated further when <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E53">Wahid</label> made an official visit to <label class="APW20001030.1921.0538-E85">Cuba</label> . </p>
