<p>While <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E21"><b>[0]</b>most Americans</label> would be content with a Sony Playstation II or a sweater twin set under the tree this year , for <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E22"><b>[1]</b>an increasing number of people</label> mere cashmere does not say `` <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E23"><b>[2]</b>I</label> love <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E24"><b>[3]</b>you</label> '' with quite the same authority as pashmina . </p>
<p>The economy may be slowing somewhat , but <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E27"><b>[4]</b>the top slice of income earners</label> is still sitting on a huge pile of wealth and is expected to propel <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E29"><b>[6]</b>such purveyors of designer delectables as Tiffany & AMP ; Co. and the Neiman Marcus Group</label> into yet another banner financial year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E30"><b>[9]</b>Every shopper</label> vaguely suspects that there is as much art as substance in the difference between an $ 8 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E31"><b>[10]</b>Revlon</label> lipstick and the <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E32"><b>[11]</b>By Terry</label> counterpart , going for $ 49. But <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E33"><b>[12]</b>luxury-goods companies</label> guard no secret more ferociously than the cost of making <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E33"><b>[13]</b>their</label> wares . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E3"><b>[14]</b>We</label> are uncomfortable even with the question , '' said <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E1"><b>[15]</b>Christina Kim</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E1"><b>[16]</b>a spokeswoman for Hermes of Paris</label> . </p>
<p>Still , it is possible to gain glimpses of enlightenment . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E4"><b>[18]</b>Public companies</label> have to report gross margins _ the money <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E4"><b>[19]</b>they</label> take in after the costs of making <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E4"><b>[20]</b>their</label> goods are deducted . </p>
<p>For <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E5"><b>[21]</b>a luxury company like Gucci or Estee Lauder</label> , that number usually runs in excess of 60 percent of total revenues . </p>
<p>That means the actual cost of making <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E5"><b>[24]</b>their</label> stuff , from sweaters to thigh-high leather boots , is less than 40 percent of the average price tag . </p>
<p>( By contrast , gross margins at <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E8"><b>[25]</b>the Gap</label> and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E9"><b>[26]</b>other chain apparel stores</label> rarely rise above 45 percent . </p>
<p>) And as profitable as cosmetics and accessories can be , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E10"><b>[27]</b>most luxury houses</label> have at least one other blockbuster that is a deep well of cash . </p>
<p>For example , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E11"><b>[28]</b>one executive at a luxury house</label> explained the rough cost of producing a high-quality leather handbag . </p>
<p>The finest leather from an <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E13"><b>[30]</b>Italian</label> ( only ! </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E14"><b>[31]</b>) tannery</label> costs $ 50 to $ 60 . </p>
<p>The labor of <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E15"><b>[32]</b>a master craftsman</label> to cut and stitch the bag costs roughly $ 72 . </p>
<p>The exclusive metal hardware , like the logo and locks , might account $ 45. Add another 5 percent for miscellaneous costs , and all in all there is $ 180 worth of bag . </p>
<p>And that stays the same , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E11"><b>[33]</b>this executive</label> says , whether <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E16"><b>[34]</b>you</label> are paying $ 460 for <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E17"><b>[35]</b>Escada</label> 's new handbag in turquoise leather or $ 4,800 for that forest green <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E18"><b>[36]</b>Hermes Kelly</label> handbag that is so frequently out of stock . </p>
<p>To be fair , there are very real expenses that will cut the final profit on luxury products : advertising , fabulous parties to create buzz , rents on <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E19"><b>[37]</b>the fanciest boulevards</label> and salaries to <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E20"><b>[38]</b>the fine-boned sales clerks who speak in charming foreign accents</label> , to name a few . </p>
