<p>Still , it is possible to gain glimpses of enlightenment . </p>

<p>For example , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E11">one executive at a luxury house</label> explained the rough cost of producing a high-quality leather handbag . </p>
<p>The finest leather from an <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0333-E13">Italian</label> ( only ! </p>

<p>The exclusive metal hardware , like the logo and locks , might account $ 45. Add another 5 percent for miscellaneous costs , and all in all there is $ 180 worth of bag . </p>
