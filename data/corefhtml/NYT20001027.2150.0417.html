<p>CANADA ARRESTS 2 IN 1985 BOMBING OF JET </p>
<p>0026 UR ; By JAMES BROOKE 0026 LR ; 0026 QC ; 0026 QL ; 0026 UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service 0026 QC ; 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E71">Canadian authorities</label> arrested <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E4">two Vancouver-area men</label> on Friday and charged <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E4">them</label> in the deaths of <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E91">329 passengers and crew members of an Air-India Boeing 747 that blew up over the Irish Sea in 1985 , en route from Canada to London</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E4">The two</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E61">Ripudan Singh Malik , 53</label> , and <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E5">Ajaib Singh Bagri , 51</label> , were arrested by <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E71">the Royal Canadian Mounted Police</label> , capping what <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E71">the Mounties</label> called the longest and most expensive criminal investigation in <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E22">the nation</label> 0027s history . </p>
<p>The downing of <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E92">the jet</label> is considered the deadliest act of sabotage in the history of aviation . </p>
<p>In an eight-count indictment , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E4">the men</label> were charged with using suitcases packed with <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E8">explosives</label> to bomb <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E7">two Air-India jets</label> on the same day , June 23 , 1985 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E92">Air-India Flight 182</label> blew up in midair , killing <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E91">all aboard</label> . </p>
<p>An hour earlier , a suitcase blew up in <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E9">Narita Airport , outside Tokyo</label> , as it was being loaded onto <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E11">Air-India Flight 301 , destined for Bangkok</label> ; it killed <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E13">two baggage handlers</label> . </p>
<p>Animosity against <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E14">Air-India</label> dated back to 1984 , when <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E16">Indian troops</label> occupied and destroyed <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18">Sikhdom 0027s holy site</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18">the Golden Temple in Amritsar</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18">The temple</label> had become <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18">a center for radicals seeking an independent Sikh state , an issue that polarized the Sikh diaspora around the world</label> . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E61">Malik , who runs a school and credit union catering to the immigrant community</label> , has long been <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E61">a suspect in the case</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E5">Bagri</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E5">a mill worker from Kamloops , British Columbia</label> , was described Thursday in <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E34">The Province in Vancouver</label> as <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E5">a key lieutenant of Talwinder Singh Parmar , a Sikh militant leader shot to death by the Indian police in 1992</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E5">Bagri</label> was also charged with trying to murder <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E39">Tara Singh Hayer</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E39">editor of The Indo-Canadian Times , North America 0027s largest Punjabi newspaper</label> , in 1998 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E39">Hayer</label> survived the attempt but three weeks later was shot to death in <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E45">his wheelchair in his garage</label> . </p>
<p>`` Although arrests have been made , this does not mark the conclusion of the <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E47">police</label> investigation , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E48">Constable Cate Galliford</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E48">spokeswoman for the Mounties 0027 Air-India task force</label> , said at news conference on Friday afternoon . </p>
