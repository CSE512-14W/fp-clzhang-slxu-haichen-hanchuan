<p>The downing of <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E92"><b>[10]</b>the jet</label> is considered the deadliest act of sabotage in the history of aviation . </p>
<p>In an eight-count indictment , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E4"><b>[11]</b>the men</label> were charged with using suitcases packed with <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E8"><b>[12]</b>explosives</label> to bomb <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E7"><b>[13]</b>two Air-India jets</label> on the same day , June 23 , 1985 . </p>

<p>Animosity against <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E14"><b>[19]</b>Air-India</label> dated back to 1984 , when <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E16"><b>[20]</b>Indian troops</label> occupied and destroyed <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18"><b>[21]</b>Sikhdom 's holy site</label> , <label class="NYT20001027.2150.0417-E18"><b>[22]</b>the Golden Temple in Amritsar</label> . </p>
