<p>Technology issues rose smartly late last week after <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42"><b>[5]</b>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan</label> said <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42"><b>[6]</b>he</label> was inclined to lower interest rates early next year . </p>
<p>High-techs also advanced Monday , but <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E44"><b>[7]</b>investors</label> are too worried about poor earnings to extend the rally , <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E45"><b>[8]</b>analysts</label> said . </p>
<p>`` There was some initial euphoria in the wake of <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42"><b>[9]</b>Alan Greenspan</label> 's clear message that <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42"><b>[10]</b>he</label> is poised to rescue the economy if it heads toward recession , but there are still some concerns especially in <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E1"><b>[11]</b>the chip sector</label> that earnings will be disappointing , '' said <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E46"><b>[12]</b>Alan Skrainka</label> , <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E46"><b>[13]</b>chief market strategist for A.G.

<p><label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E40"><b>[31]</b>Wall Street</label> considered the protracted political uncertainty as a reason to sell tech stocks and retreat to blue chips . </p>
