<p>Technology issues rose smartly late last week after <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42">Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan</label> said <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42">he</label> was inclined to lower interest rates early next year . </p>
<p>High-techs also advanced Monday , but <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E44">investors</label> are too worried about poor earnings to extend the rally , <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E45">analysts</label> said . </p>
<p>`` There was some initial euphoria in the wake of <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42">Alan Greenspan</label> 0027s clear message that <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E42">he</label> is poised to rescue the economy if it heads toward recession , but there are still some concerns especially in <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E1">the chip sector</label> that earnings will be disappointing , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E46">Alan Skrainka</label> , <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E46">chief market strategist for A.G.

<p>00270027 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.91 to 10,818.71 . </p>
<p>Broader indicators were lower . </p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index was down 39.82 at 2,975.28 , and the Standard 0026 Poor 0027s 500 index was off 2.84 at 1,377.36 . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001212.1729.0582-E3">Some people</label> feel that 3,000 in the Nasdaq is an important level . </p>
