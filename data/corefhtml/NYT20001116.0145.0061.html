<p>EDITORIAL : A PRESIDENTIAL JOURNEY TO VIETNAM </p>
<p>& UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E19"><b>[0]</b>The New York Times</label> said in an editorial for Thursday , Nov. 16 : <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E34"><b>[2]</b>The last U.S. president to visit Vietnam</label> was <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E34"><b>[4]</b>Richard Nixon , who traveled to the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon in 1969 , at the height of a war that eventually took 58,000 American and 3 million Vietnamese lives</label> . </p>
<p>Thursday , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[11]</b>Bill Clinton</label> begins a three-day trip to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E42"><b>[12]</b>Hanoi</label> and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E37"><b>[13]</b>Ho Chi Minh City , as Saigon is now called</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[15]</b>Clinton</label> 's visit is striking evidence of how far <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E1"><b>[16]</b>the two countries</label> have moved beyond the rancor of that conflict . </p>
<p>But if a healthy new relationship is to be built , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[17]</b>Hanoi</label> must ease bureaucratic restrictions on foreign investment and show greater respect for the civil and religious liberties of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[19]</b>its people</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[20]</b>Clinton</label> 's itinerary inevitably looks back to war-related issues , like repatriating the remains of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E2"><b>[21]</b>Americans lost in action</label> and helping remove <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E3"><b>[22]</b>land mines still buried in Vietnamese soil</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[25]</b>he</label> should also use <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[26]</b>his</label> visit to press for a faster pace of political and economic reform . </p>
<p>Much has changed in <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[27]</b>Vietnam</label> over the past three decades . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E5"><b>[28]</b>Most of its 79 million people</label> have been born since the war ended , and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E6"><b>[31]</b>younger Vietnamese</label> , in particular , look admiringly upon <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E39"><b>[32]</b>American</label> prosperity and personal freedoms . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E7"><b>[33]</b>the Communist Party</label> still jealously monopolizes <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[34]</b>government</label> power and public political debate , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E9"><b>[35]</b>ordinary Vietnamese</label> are no longer afraid to talk about politics in private . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E10"><b>[36]</b>anyone who speaks out for more accountable government or wider freedom</label> faces stern repression . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[39]</b>Hanoi</label> continues to jail <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E12"><b>[40]</b>open critics</label> , persecute <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E13"><b>[41]</b>religious believers</label> , censor <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E14"><b>[42]</b>newspapers</label> , restrict the Internet and otherwise suppress dissent . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[43]</b>It</label> routinely violates provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[44]</b>it</label> acceded in 1982 , guaranteeing freedom of expression , association and religious belief and prohibiting arbitrary detentions . </p>
<p>After a disastrous decade of trying to impose <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E15"><b>[45]</b>North Vietnam</label> 's austere and repressive communism on <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E16"><b>[46]</b>the more freewheeling South</label> , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E17"><b>[48]</b>the country 's leaders</label> reversed course in the late 1980s and began encouraging <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E16"><b>[49]</b>Southern</label> style entrepreneurship . </p>
<p>But over the past three years , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[50]</b>Vietnam</label> 's program of market liberalization has stalled as <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E20"><b>[52]</b>the country 's political leaders</label> have grown concerned about decentralizing economic power . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E21"><b>[53]</b>Foreign investors</label> have become frustrated with the <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8"><b>[54]</b>Vietnam</label> 's bureaucratic hurdles and have taken <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E21"><b>[55]</b>their</label> investments to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E22"><b>[56]</b>China</label> and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E23"><b>[58]</b>other Southeast Asian nations</label> . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[59]</b>Clinton</label> talks to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E25"><b>[60]</b>university students in Hanoi</label> on Friday <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[62]</b>he</label> should speak plainly about the merits of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E33"><b>[63]</b>human</label> rights , democracy , free markets and the rule of law , as <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[64]</b>he</label> did during <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[65]</b>his</label> 1998 trip to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E22"><b>[66]</b>China</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[67]</b>He</label> also needs to raise these issues in <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[68]</b>his</label> discussions with <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E26"><b>[71]</b>government and Communist Party leaders</label> as well . </p>
<p>Establishing firm legal protections for <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E29"><b>[72]</b>Vietnamese-Americans who want to return home to do business</label> should be an important part of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[76]</b>his</label> agenda . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41"><b>[77]</b>He</label> would also do well to follow the advice of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E30"><b>[79]</b>Sen. John McCain</label> and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E32"><b>[80]</b>others</label> and seek to expand legal exchange programs to cover press and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E33"><b>[81]</b>human</label> rights issues as well as commercial law . </p>
