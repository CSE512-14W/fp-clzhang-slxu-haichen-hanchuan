<p>While <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E7">the Communist Party</label> still jealously monopolizes <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">government</label> power and public political debate , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E9">ordinary Vietnamese</label> are no longer afraid to talk about politics in private . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E10">anyone who speaks out for more accountable government or wider freedom</label> faces stern repression . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">Hanoi</label> continues to jail <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E12">open critics</label> , persecute <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E13">religious believers</label> , censor <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E14">newspapers</label> , restrict the Internet and otherwise suppress dissent . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">It</label> routinely violates provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">it</label> acceded in 1982 , guaranteeing freedom of expression , association and religious belief and prohibiting arbitrary detentions . </p>
<p>After a disastrous decade of trying to impose <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E15">North Vietnam</label> 0027s austere and repressive communism on <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E16">the more freewheeling South</label> , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E17">the country 0027s leaders</label> reversed course in the late 1980s and began encouraging <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E16">Southern</label> style entrepreneurship . </p>
<p>But over the past three years , <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">Vietnam</label> 0027s program of market liberalization has stalled as <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E20">the country 0027s political leaders</label> have grown concerned about decentralizing economic power . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E21">Foreign investors</label> have become frustrated with the <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E8">Vietnam</label> 0027s bureaucratic hurdles and have taken <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E21">their</label> investments to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E22">China</label> and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E23">other Southeast Asian nations</label> . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">Clinton</label> talks to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E25">university students in Hanoi</label> on Friday <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">he</label> should speak plainly about the merits of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E33">human</label> rights , democracy , free markets and the rule of law , as <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">he</label> did during <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">his</label> 1998 trip to <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E22">China</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">He</label> also needs to raise these issues in <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">his</label> discussions with <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E26">government and Communist Party leaders</label> as well . </p>
<p>Establishing firm legal protections for <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E29">Vietnamese-Americans who want to return home to do business</label> should be an important part of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">his</label> agenda . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E41">He</label> would also do well to follow the advice of <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E30">Sen. John McCain</label> and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E32">others</label> and seek to expand legal exchange programs to cover press and <label class="NYT20001116.0145.0061-E33">human</label> rights issues as well as commercial law . </p>
