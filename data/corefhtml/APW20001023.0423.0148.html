<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E20"><b>[0]</b>VILLAHERMOSA , Mexico</label> <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E43"><b>[2]</b>(AP)</label> _ In an important victory for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[4]</b>Mexico 's embattled ruling party</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[5]</b>Manuel Andrade</label> on Sunday was declared <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[6]</b>the winner of the disputed governor 's race for oil-rich Tabasco state</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E49"><b>[10]</b>Members of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party</label> held a peaceful march earlier Sunday , saying <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E49"><b>[12]</b>they</label> would not recognize the official results , believing they were marred by fraud . </p>
<p>Preliminary results from the election a week ago gave <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[13]</b>Andrade</label> a slight lead of 44 percent to 43 percent for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24"><b>[15]</b>opposition candidate Raul Ojeda</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E53"><b>[16]</b>Election officials</label> had said the race was too close to declare <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E1"><b>[17]</b>a winner</label> , and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E53"><b>[18]</b>they</label> spent the past week pouring over ballots to determine the official results . </p>
<p>Late Sunday , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E2"><b>[19]</b>election officials</label> announced that <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[20]</b>Andrade</label> has won by more than 8,000 votes . </p>
<p>The announcement prompted <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E3"><b>[23]</b>the Democratic Revolution and National Action Party representatives</label> to resign <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E3"><b>[24]</b>their</label> spots on <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E6"><b>[25]</b>the electoral council</label> . </p>
<p>Tearing up a copy of the electoral law , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E7"><b>[27]</b>Democratic Revolution 's Lorena Villavicencio</label> said <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E7"><b>[28]</b>she</label> refused to `` certify fraud . </p>
<p>'' But <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E8"><b>[30]</b>the ruling party 's representative</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E8"><b>[31]</b>Carlos Jimenez</label> , said : `` <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[32]</b>We</label> won the election , and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[33]</b>we</label> won it without fraud . </p>
<p>'' The election was an important test for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[35]</b>Mexico 's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which recently lost its first presidential election since its creation in 1929</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10"><b>[41]</b>The National Action Party 's Vicente Fox</label> will be sworn in as <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10"><b>[42]</b>president</label> Dec. 1. The <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E13"><b>[43]</b>Tabasco</label> race has been seen as an indicator of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[44]</b>the PRI</label> 's ability to halt a possible collapse . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[45]</b>The party , which never admitted losing any statewide race before 1989</label> , has lost several gubernatorial races in recent years _ most recently in <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E14"><b>[47]</b>neighboring Chiapas</label> . </p>
<p>The presidential loss set off a battle for control of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[48]</b>the PRI , which has been dominated by the nation 's president since the early 1930s</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16"><b>[52]</b>A favorite for the leadership</label> is <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16"><b>[56]</b>outgoing Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo , who has tried to use the election here as a demonstration of his popularity</label> . </p>
<p>Yet <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E21"><b>[60]</b>observer groups</label> and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E22"><b>[61]</b>opposition parties</label> have accused the <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E13"><b>[62]</b>Tabasco</label> elections of having the same sort of irregularities and fraud that were common in the <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[63]</b>PRI-dominated</label> elections of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E42"><b>[64]</b>Mexico</label> 's past , and many blame <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16"><b>[65]</b>Madrazo</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16"><b>[66]</b>Madrazo</label> has denied the claims , saying <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[67]</b>Andrade</label> is <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[68]</b>the true winner</label> . </p>
<p>On Sunday , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44"><b>[69]</b>the ruling party</label> held a rally celebrating <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23"><b>[70]</b>his</label> victory . </p>
