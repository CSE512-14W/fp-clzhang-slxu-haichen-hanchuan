<p>Opposition Rejects Mexican Vote </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E20">VILLAHERMOSA , Mexico</label> <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E43">(AP)</label> _ In an important victory for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">Mexico 0027s embattled ruling party</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">Manuel Andrade</label> on Sunday was declared <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">the winner of the disputed governor 0027s race for oil-rich Tabasco state</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E49">Members of the opposition Democratic Revolution Party</label> held a peaceful march earlier Sunday , saying <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E49">they</label> would not recognize the official results , believing they were marred by fraud . </p>
<p>Preliminary results from the election a week ago gave <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">Andrade</label> a slight lead of 44 percent to 43 percent for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24">opposition candidate Raul Ojeda</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E53">Election officials</label> had said the race was too close to declare <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E1">a winner</label> , and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E53">they</label> spent the past week pouring over ballots to determine the official results . </p>
<p>Late Sunday , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E2">election officials</label> announced that <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">Andrade</label> has won by more than 8,000 votes . </p>
<p>The announcement prompted <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E3">the Democratic Revolution and National Action Party representatives</label> to resign <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E3">their</label> spots on <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E6">the electoral council</label> . </p>
<p>Tearing up a copy of the electoral law , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E7">Democratic Revolution 0027s Lorena Villavicencio</label> said <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E7">she</label> refused to `` certify fraud . </p>
<p>00270027 But <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E8">the ruling party 0027s representative</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E8">Carlos Jimenez</label> , said : `` <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">We</label> won the election , and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">we</label> won it without fraud . </p>
<p>00270027 The election was an important test for <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">Mexico 0027s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , which recently lost its first presidential election since its creation in 1929</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10">The National Action Party 0027s Vicente Fox</label> will be sworn in as <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10">president</label> Dec. 1. The <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E13">Tabasco</label> race has been seen as an indicator of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">the PRI</label> 0027s ability to halt a possible collapse . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">The party , which never admitted losing any statewide race before 1989</label> , has lost several gubernatorial races in recent years _ most recently in <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E14">neighboring Chiapas</label> . </p>
<p>The presidential loss set off a battle for control of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">the PRI , which has been dominated by the nation 0027s president since the early 1930s</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16">A favorite for the leadership</label> is <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16">outgoing Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo , who has tried to use the election here as a demonstration of his popularity</label> . </p>
<p>Yet <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E21">observer groups</label> and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E22">opposition parties</label> have accused the <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E13">Tabasco</label> elections of having the same sort of irregularities and fraud that were common in the <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">PRI-dominated</label> elections of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E42">Mexico</label> 0027s past , and many blame <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16">Madrazo</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E16">Madrazo</label> has denied the claims , saying <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">Andrade</label> is <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">the true winner</label> . </p>
<p>On Sunday , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">the ruling party</label> held a rally celebrating <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">his</label> victory . </p>
<p>Earlier in the day , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24">Ojeda</label> said <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10">Fox</label> should recognize <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24">him</label> as <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24">the victor</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E25">We</label> call on <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10">Vicente Fox</label> to comply with <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E10">his</label> promise to guarantee democracy in <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E42">the entire country</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E24">he</label> told <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E26">a cheering crowd</label> . </p>
<p>After days of reviewing ballots , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">one electoral official</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">Joaquin Diaz</label> , said <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">he</label> would not validate the results and called on <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E29">other election advisers</label> to do the same . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">I</label> have many doubts , and <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">I</label> do n0027t believe that <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">I</label> _ or <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E30">the rest of the advisers</label> _ have the instruments necessary to certify the results , 00270027 <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">he</label> said , adding that <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">he</label> thought <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E32">federal election officials</label> should step in . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E33">Floricel Medina</label> , <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E33">local director for the ruling party</label> , said <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">Diaz</label> 0027s comments `` are not reason enough to annul the will of <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E35">the people</label> . </p>
<p>It 0027s a personal opinion . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E27">Diaz</label> accused <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E36">the president of Tabasco 0027s electoral institute</label> of favoring <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E44">the PRI</label> and pressuring <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E38">election officials</label> to close the preliminary results early to benefit <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E23">Andrade</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E39">Election officials</label> denied the accusations , saying <label class="APW20001023.0423.0148-E39">they</label> reviewed each ballot . </p>
