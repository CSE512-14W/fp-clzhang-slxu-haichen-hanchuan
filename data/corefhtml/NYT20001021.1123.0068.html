<p><label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E16">ROME</label> _ Fueling speculation that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">John Paul II</label> might retire at the end of this year , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">a Belgian cardinal</label> says <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">he</label> believes that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">the frail , ailing pope</label> could do exactly that . </p>
<p>`` It would not surprise <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">me</label> if <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">the pope</label> were to retire after 2000 , 00270027 says <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">Cardinal Godfried Danneels</label> in a book to be published on Monday in <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E34">Belgium</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">He</label> wanted at all costs to reach the Jubilee year 2000 , but <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">I</label> consider <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">him</label> capable of retiring afterward . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">Danneels</label> is not <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E37">the first Roman Catholic Church official</label> to broach a topic considered taboo at <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E2">the Vatican</label> , but <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">he</label> is <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">the highest-ranking leader</label> to address the question so openly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E1">The Vatican spokesman</label> , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E1">Joaquin Navarro-Valls</label> , issued a terse reaction , saying `` this is the personal opinion of <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">Cardinal Danneels</label> that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E2">we</label> do not confirm . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">The cardinal</label> spoke in answer to a question in an interview included in <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">his</label> book , `` Frankly Speaking : Six Conversations with <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E33">the Cardinal</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Speculation that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">John Paul</label> might step down if <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> health deteriorates to the extent that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> cannot fulfill <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> duties has echoed around <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E4">the church</label> ever since <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> turned 75 , the mandatory retirement age for <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E5">bishops</label> , in 1995 . </p>
<p>The rumors grew louder as <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">the pope</label> visibly weakened and this year passed <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> 80th birthday , the age at which <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E6">cardinals</label> become ineligible to vote in a conclave for <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E7">the next pope</label> . </p>
<p>In January , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E8">Bishop Karl Lehmann</label> , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E8">leader of the German Bishops Conference</label> , unleashed a flurry of articles in the <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E12">Italian</label> press when <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E8">he</label> told <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E13">a questioner</label> on <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E14">German</label> radio that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E8">he</label> believed that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">the pope</label> would resign for the good of <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E4">the church</label> if <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> felt <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> could not fulfill <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E31">papal</label> functions . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">The pope , whose speech is slurred and who shakes badly because of a neurological disorder</label> , has nevertheless marshaled <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> strength to preside over this year 0027s Jubilee , a Holy Year of <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E4">the church</label> . </p>
<p>Once the Holy Year ends on Jan. 6 , however , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E15">many</label> wonder whether <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> might retire . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">The pope</label> has not addressed the issue directly , but <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> few comments on the subject suggest that <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> is determined to serve out <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> full term . </p>
<p>On <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">his</label> 75th birthday , <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> told <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E17">an audience of pilgrims at St. Peter 0027s</label> , referring to <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E19">God</label> , `` <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">I</label> leave it to <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E19">him</label> to decide when and how <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E19">he</label> wants to relieve <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">me</label> of this service . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">The pope</label> keeps up a full schedule , and <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E2">the Vatican</label> says <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E32">he</label> wants to make other important trips in 2001 . </p>
<p>There is no detailed procedure for a <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E31">papal</label> resignation , and little precedent . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E20">The last pope to resign voluntarily</label> was <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E20">Celestine V</label> in 1294 . </p>
<p>But canon law does allow <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E22">a pope</label> to resign , saying it is valid as long as <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E22">the pope</label> does it freely . </p>
<p>There are no explicit instructions on how <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E2">the Vatican</label> should function if <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E22">a pope</label> had a stroke or went into a coma and could not express <label class="NYT20001021.1123.0068-E22">his</label> wishes . </p>
