<p>But <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E54">Milosevic</label> appears to retain enough residual power to block <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E55">Kostunica</label> 0027s reforms and _ through <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E6">proxies who still control Serbia 0027s police</label> _ <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E52">Yugoslavia</label> 0027s reintegration into <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E9">the world</label> . </p>

<p>After initial speculation that <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E55">he</label> was hiding out , <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E54">a visibly shaken Milosevic</label> appeared on TV late Friday to concede defeat and congratulate <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E55">Kostunica</label> on <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E55">his</label> victory . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E54">I</label> intend to rest a little and spend some more time with <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E14">my family</label> and especially with <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E15">my grandson</label> , <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E15">Marko</label> , and after that to help <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E17">my party</label> gain force and contribute to future prosperity , 00270027 <label class="APW20001007.1745.0378-E54">he</label> said . </p>
