<p>SPORTS COLUMN : LEMIEUX 0027S COMEBACK IS IRRESISTIBLE </p>
<p>0026 UR ; By JOE LAPOINTE 0026 LR ; 0026 QC ; 0026 QL ; 0026 UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service 0026 QC ; 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E16">You</label> did not have to admire <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E51">Richard Nixon</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E55">Elvis Presley</label> or <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E56">Muhammad Ali</label> to admit that <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E57">all three</label> staged successful comebacks . </p>
<p>As <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E51">president of the United States</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E55">king of rock 0027n 0027 roll</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E56">heavyweight champion of the world</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E57">they</label> enjoyed impressive second acts in <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E57">their</label> <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E58">American</label> lives . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E61">each man</label> 0027s denouement _ one politically scandalous , another self-destructive and the third evoking sympathy _ lingers large in the mind . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Mario Lemieux</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">the Pittsburgh hockey star</label> , may never be <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E2">a transcendent personality like Nixon , Presley or Ali</label> , and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">his</label> future will not necessarily include a tragic trajectory . </p>
<p>But , despite the initial success of <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> 0027s return to the ice , it is realistic to retain a few doubts about what will come . </p>
<p>In sports terms , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">his</label> closest parallel is <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E3">Michael Jordan , who spent almost two seasons away from the NBA before returning in 1995 to lead the Chicago Bulls to three more championships</label> . </p>
<p>Like <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E3">Jordan</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> became <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">part-owner of a team after retirement</label> . </p>
<p>Unlike <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E3">Jordan</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> is now both <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">an equity investor</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">an employee</label> . </p>
<p>After 3 1/2 years of retirement , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> played for <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">the Penguins</label> Wednesday , contributing one goal and two assists to a 5-0 victory over <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E7">Toronto</label> . </p>
<p>In so doing , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> pushed <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E8">the NHL</label> into the realm of real news , something <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E8">it</label> has not experienced since <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E9">Wayne Gretzky</label> 0027s highly orchestrated retirement in 1999 . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> comeback story is hard to resist because it has all the hooks . </p>
<p>The first is talent . </p>
<p>As <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">the second-best player of the Gretzky era</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> never got the recognition <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">he</label> deserved . </p>
<p>The second factor is health . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> survived Hodgkin 0027s disease and chronic back problems . </p>
<p>The third element is money . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> rescued <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">his team</label> from bankruptcy last season by exchanging deferred salary for an ownership stake . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">the franchise</label> still seeks <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E12">new investors</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E13">a new arena to replace the NHL 0027s oldest rink</label> . </p>
<p>Mix in the <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E25">family</label> angle _ <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E15">his young son</label> wants to see <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">him</label> play ! </p>
<p>Finally , sprinkle it generously with competitive flavoring because <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> 0027s presence could transform <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">a mediocre , underperforming team</label> into <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">a dynamic and overachieving team</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E17">The other Pittsburgh superstar</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E17">Jaromir Jagr</label> , admires <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux , who might change Jagr 0027s recent sulks and pouts into shouts of triumph</label> . </p>
<p>At the very least , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> will attract <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E19">ticket buyers</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E20">television viewers</label> to a wintry sport that usually spins its wheels along the road to show-business success . </p>
<p>So what could be wrong with this picture ? </p>
<p>Start with health . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> says <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">his</label> back has never felt better . </p>
<p>One way to change that is by playing hockey , which punishes <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E52">even young , healthy bodies</label> . </p>
<p>Can <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> produce at a high level at age 35 ? </p>
<p>Perhaps , although crackdowns on obstruction fouls , such as this season 0027s , tend to weaken around mid-schedule and evaporate come playoff time . </p>
<p>This helped persuade <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> to retire the first time . </p>
<p>The third caveat could be troubles , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">team-wide</label> , on the ice and above it . </p>
<p>Despite <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E22">a shrewd general manager in Craig Patrick</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E24">a loyal fan base that understands the sport</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">the Pittsburgh franchise</label> has seemed unsteady since the Stanley Cup years of 1991 and 1992 . </p>
<p>The market is of modest size . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E27">The new coach</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E27">Ivan Hlinka</label> , is <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E27">one of the NHL 0027s first from Europe</label> , and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E27">his</label> adjustment curve has been steep . </p>
<p>Should <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">the Penguins</label> falter as <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">a team</label> in the short term or as <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">a business</label> in the long term , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> could be vulnerable to disappointment and even blame . </p>
<p>A coincidence of interest in good times might seem like a conflict during struggles . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E31">who</label> wants to dwell on the potential downside ? </p>
<p>Consider the vibration at the <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E32">Devils</label> game against <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E33">Columbus</label> in <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E34">the Meadowlands</label> on Wednesday night . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E32">the Stanley Cup champions</label> played <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E33">the expansion Blue Jackets</label> , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E36">fans</label> in the seats kept glancing at the out-of-town scoreboard and murmuring about <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> every time the electric sign posted another <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">Pittsburgh</label> goal . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E37">the press room</label> , between periods , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E38">reporters</label> gathered to watch <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Lemieux</label> 0027s televised highlights from <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E14">the Igloo</label> . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E39">the corridor</label> afterward , <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E40">two Columbus assistants</label> met . </p>
<p>`` Did <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E43">you</label> hear about <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">Mario</label> ? </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E42">one</label> asked . </p>
<p>`` Yeah ! </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E43">his colleague</label> replied . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E40">Both men</label> were smiling , as happy about that distant development as <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E40">they</label> were with a spunky 2-2 tie in <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E44">Continental Arena</label> . </p>
<p>Even <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E45">skeptics</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E46">cynics</label> look to see the bright side . </p>
<p>It is that time of year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E54">The sun</label> is turning back toward <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E47">the Northern Hemisphere</label> , shining on winter ice as the days grow longer . </p>
<p>Both <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E49">friends</label> and <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E50">foes</label> of <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E1">the Pittsburgh Penguins</label> have a rooting interest in a Happy New Year for <label class="NYT20001228.2223.0362-E10">the athlete they call le Magnifique</label> . </p>
