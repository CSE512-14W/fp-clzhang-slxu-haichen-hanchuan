<p>But pro wrestling did manage to leave a mark on the first <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74"><b>[6]</b>XFL</label> draft Saturday . </p>
<p>After all , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E70"><b>[7]</b>Austin</label> 's mass-produced signature was right there on a <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74"><b>[8]</b>league</label> credential . </p>

<p>A black football trimmed in red and white , no fair catches on punts , no <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E4"><b>[16]</b>quarterback-in-the-grasp</label> rule , miked huddles and cameras everywhere _ on <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E1"><b>[17]</b>the sideline</label> , in <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E2"><b>[18]</b>locker rooms</label> and in the helmets of <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E3"><b>[19]</b>selected players</label> . </p>

<p>`` It 's simple , '' <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8"><b>[31]</b>DeVito</label> said of <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74"><b>[33]</b>his league</label> 's premise . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E13"><b>[35]</b>Nobody</label> owns football . </p>
<p>'' According to <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74"><b>[36]</b>the league</label> 's Web site , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E14"><b>[37]</b>a quarterback</label> 's base salary for the 10-game schedule will be about $ 50,000 , but <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E15"><b>[38]</b>players</label> will be able to collect $ 2,500 bonuses for each win . </p>
<p>It 's incentive pay and that 's fine with <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E16"><b>[39]</b>at least one of the league 's coaches</label> . </p>

<p>`` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21"><b>[62]</b>I</label> 've been in a couple of start-up situations and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21"><b>[63]</b>I</label> know the pitfalls , '' <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21"><b>[64]</b>Meyer</label> said . </p>

<p>No. Nothing is , '' <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E30"><b>[71]</b>LA Xtreme coach Al Luginbill</label> said . </p>
<p>`` But <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E32"><b>[72]</b>we</label> 're going to shock <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E33"><b>[73]</b>some people</label> . </p>
<p>'' Before the draft started , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E34"><b>[74]</b>the eight teams</label> were allowed to protect picks from <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E35"><b>[75]</b>three colleges</label> each . </p>
<p>Among <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E36"><b>[76]</b>those designated</label> were <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E36"><b>[78]</b>former NFL first-rounders</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E39"><b>[79]</b>Mike Croel</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E40"><b>[80]</b>Alvin Harper</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E41"><b>[81]</b>Tommy Maddox</label> and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E42"><b>[82]</b>Marcus Nash</label> . </p>
<p>Once the draft began , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E43"><b>[83]</b>five quarterbacks</label> were <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E43"><b>[84]</b>the first players chosen</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E45"><b>[87]</b>Ex-Maryland quarterback Scott Milanovich</label> had the distinction of being <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E45"><b>[89]</b>the first XFL player selected _ by the Xtreme</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E22"><b>[91]</b>The Enforcers</label> , with the last pick of the first round , nabbed <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E51"><b>[93]</b>running back John Avery</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E51"><b>[94]</b>a first-round pick of the Miami Dolphins in 1998</label> . </p>
<p>And near the end the first day _ the draft continues Sunday and Monday _ <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E54"><b>[97]</b>quarterback Jim Druckenmiller</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E54"><b>[98]</b>a first-round choice of the San Francisco 49ers in 1997</label> , was selected by <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E57"><b>[100]</b>the Maniax</label> with the 78th selection . </p>

<p>`` Interestingly , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66"><b>[112]</b>all the coaches</label> tell <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8"><b>[113]</b>me</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66"><b>[114]</b>they</label> got exactly <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E67"><b>[115]</b>the players they wanted</label> , '' <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8"><b>[117]</b>DeVito</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And since <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66"><b>[118]</b>they</label> are still undefeated , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8"><b>[119]</b>I</label> guess that 's OK. '' </p>
