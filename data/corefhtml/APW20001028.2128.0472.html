<p>XFL Has First Draft </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E20">CHICAGO</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E68">(AP)</label> _ `` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E70">Stone Cold 00270027 Steve Austin</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E71">The Rock</label> and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E72">Triple H</label> were n0027t among <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E69">the selections</label> . </p>
<p>But pro wrestling did manage to leave a mark on the first <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">XFL</label> draft Saturday . </p>
<p>After all , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E70">Austin</label> 0027s mass-produced signature was right there on a <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">league</label> credential . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">The new league</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">a joint venture of the World Wrestling Federation and NBC</label> , features <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E78">some former NFL first-rounders</label> while promising a no holds-barred approach and off-the-mat rules when <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">it</label> begins in February . </p>
<p>A black football trimmed in red and white , no fair catches on punts , no <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E4">quarterback-in-the-grasp</label> rule , miked huddles and cameras everywhere _ on <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E1">the sideline</label> , in <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E2">locker rooms</label> and in the helmets of <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E3">selected players</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">We</label> 0027re going for something that <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E5">millions of kids</label> played in <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E6">the school yard</label> , something that resonates with <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E7">people who 0027ve enjoyed the game on all different levels</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">league president Basil DeVito</label> said after helping conduct Saturday 0027s first 10 rounds of the draft before <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E10">about 100 fans</label> at <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E11">a hotel near O 0027Hare International Airport</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s simple , 00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">DeVito</label> said of <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">his league</label> 0027s premise . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E13">Nobody</label> owns it . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E13">Nobody</label> owns football . </p>
<p>00270027 According to <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">the league</label> 0027s Web site , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E14">a quarterback</label> 0027s base salary for the 10-game schedule will be about $ 50,000 , but <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E15">players</label> will be able to collect $ 2,500 bonuses for each win . </p>
<p>It 0027s incentive pay and that 0027s fine with <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E16">at least one of the league 0027s coaches</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">We</label> have no negotiations , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E18">you</label> have <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E19">no owners in there</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E18">You</label> have <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E19">no owners in there in who are going to disrupt the progress of the league</label> because <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">it</label> 0027s centrally controlled , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">Chicago Enforcers coach Ron Meyer</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">former head coach of the Patriots and Colts</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">who</label> took the job when <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E26">Chicago favorite Dick Butkus</label> resigned to take a job in <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E28">the league office</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">I</label> 0027ve been in a couple of start-up situations and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">I</label> know the pitfalls , 00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">Meyer</label> said . </p>
<p>`` It is a work in progress , certainly . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">we</label> 0027re light years ahead of what <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E21">I</label> envisioned . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">DeVito</label> said <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E74">the league</label> had sold 120,000 season tickets so far and hopes to average 25,000 fans a game . </p>
<p>`` Is it going to be perfect ? </p>
<p>No. Nothing is , 00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E30">LA Xtreme coach Al Luginbill</label> said . </p>
<p>`` But <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E32">we</label> 0027re going to shock <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E33">some people</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Before the draft started , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E34">the eight teams</label> were allowed to protect picks from <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E35">three colleges</label> each . </p>
<p>Among <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E36">those designated</label> were <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E36">former NFL first-rounders</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E39">Mike Croel</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E40">Alvin Harper</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E41">Tommy Maddox</label> and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E42">Marcus Nash</label> . </p>
<p>Once the draft began , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E43">five quarterbacks</label> were <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E43">the first players chosen</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E45">Ex-Maryland quarterback Scott Milanovich</label> had the distinction of being <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E45">the first XFL player selected _ by the Xtreme</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E22">The Enforcers</label> , with the last pick of the first round , nabbed <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E51">running back John Avery</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E51">a first-round pick of the Miami Dolphins in 1998</label> . </p>
<p>And near the end the first day _ the draft continues Sunday and Monday _ <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E54">quarterback Jim Druckenmiller</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E54">a first-round choice of the San Francisco 49ers in 1997</label> , was selected by <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E57">the Maniax</label> with the 78th selection . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E51">Avery</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E54">Druckenmiller</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E58">running back Vaughn Dunbar</label> and <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E60">linebacker Craig Powell</label> , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E62">who</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E62">both</label> went to <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E63">the San Francisco Demons</label> , were <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E64">all NFL first-round selections</label> . </p>
<p>`` Interestingly , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66">all the coaches</label> tell <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">me</label> <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66">they</label> got exactly <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E67">the players they wanted</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">DeVito</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And since <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E66">they</label> are still undefeated , <label class="APW20001028.2128.0472-E8">I</label> guess that 0027s OK. 00270027 </p>
