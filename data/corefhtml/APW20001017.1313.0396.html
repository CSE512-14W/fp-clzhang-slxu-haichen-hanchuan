LOUIS</label> <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E65"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ As <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E4"><b>[3]</b>Republican George W. Bush</label> and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[5]</b>Democrat Al Gore</label> prepared to perch on stools and take <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E72"><b>[6]</b>voters</label> ' questions in a crucial third debate , the sudden death of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1"><b>[9]</b>Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan</label> cast a pall over <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76"><b>[10]</b>their</label> final meeting . </p>
<p>After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning , plans were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on schedule , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E77"><b>[11]</b>officials of both campaigns</label> said . </p>
<p>`` In the end , there was general agreement that <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1"><b>[13]</b>Mel Carnahan</label> would have wanted <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E2"><b>[14]</b>us</label> to go forward , '' <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E3"><b>[17]</b>a senior Bush campaign official</label> said , speaking on condition of anonymity . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E6"><b>[19]</b>Bush 's wife</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E6"><b>[20]</b>Laura</label> , canceled plans for a morning rally . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E8"><b>[23]</b>Bush campaign officials</label> also decided to tone down a post-debate rally , and were even considering canceling it . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[24]</b>Gore</label> had n't planned any events before the debate . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1"><b>[25]</b>Carnahan</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1"><b>[26]</b>a Democrat who was running for the Senate</label> , campaigned with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[29]</b>Gore</label> whenever <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[30]</b>the vice president</label> was in <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E11"><b>[31]</b>Missouri</label> and would have accompanied <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[32]</b>Gore</label> aboard <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E12"><b>[33]</b>Air Force II</label> to a <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E13"><b>[34]</b>Kansas City</label> rally on Wednesday . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[35]</b>Gore</label> called <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E15"><b>[37]</b>Mrs. Carnahan</label> with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[38]</b>his</label> condolences after the news broke Monday night , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E17"><b>[39]</b>aides</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E18"><b>[40]</b>We</label> 're all waking up , honestly , to the tragedy and the pain of it and the shock of it , '' <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E19"><b>[44]</b>Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman</label> said Tuesday morning on CNN . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E28"><b>[47]</b>The Bush and Gore campaigns</label> did not talk to <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E22"><b>[48]</b>each other</label> directly about the possibility of postponement , but went through <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23"><b>[50]</b>the debate commission 's director</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23"><b>[51]</b>Janet Brown</label> , in a series of pre-dawn phone calls . </p>
<p>Eventually , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23"><b>[52]</b>Brown</label> recommended that the debate should go on , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E26"><b>[53]</b>neither side</label> objected , according to <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E27"><b>[55]</b>campaign officials</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E25"><b>[56]</b>The commission</label> was to announce the plans later Tuesday , with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E29"><b>[57]</b>each candidate</label> given time at the debate 's start to say a few words about <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1"><b>[58]</b>Carnahan , who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane</label> . </p>
<p>With the larger bloc of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E31"><b>[61]</b>uncommitted voters across the nation</label> apparently holding the key to the election , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76"><b>[63]</b>both candidates</label> were clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as planned . </p>
<p>The informal question-and-answer format is one <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[64]</b>Gore</label> is comfortable with , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[65]</b>he</label> promised on Monday to `` just have an open meeting , '' as <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[66]</b>he</label> had done many times before . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E4"><b>[67]</b>Bush , who has less formal debate experience than the vice president but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two face-offs</label> , vowed to `` just tell it like it is . </p>
<p>'' The debate , just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election , will be held on <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E33"><b>[71]</b>the campus of Washington University</label> . </p>
<p>While <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35"><b>[73]</b>the moderator</label> will be <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35"><b>[74]</b>the same as in the Boston and Winston-Salem , N.C. , debates</label> _ <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35"><b>[78]</b>Jim Lehrer of PBS</label> _ questions this time will come from <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E41"><b>[79]</b>the audience</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E42"><b>[80]</b>The Gallup polling organization</label> , assigned by <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E25"><b>[81]</b>the Commission on Presidential Debates</label> to recruit <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E43"><b>[82]</b>questioners</label> , started with a random sample of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E44"><b>[83]</b>all registered voters in St. Louis and its suburbs</label> , and then screened out <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E46"><b>[87]</b>all but `` uncommitted voters</label> , '' said <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E10"><b>[89]</b>Frank Newport</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E10"><b>[91]</b>Gallup 's executive editor</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E49"><b>[92]</b>The result</label> was <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E49"><b>[93]</b>a group of area voters who say they could support either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the other</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E52"><b>[101]</b>The theater-in-the-round stage</label> will be informally set with two stools and surrounded by <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E53"><b>[102]</b>100 questioners</label> and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E54"><b>[103]</b>an additional 500 onlookers</label> . </p>
<p>Tuesday night 's debate marks the beginning of the final stretch . </p>
<p>And , with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck , any stumble could have major impact on a contest in which <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76"><b>[104]</b>both candidates</label> are fiercely wooing <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E55"><b>[105]</b>a dwindling band of undecided voters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[107]</b>Gore</label> held a mock debate on Monday , inviting <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E57"><b>[108]</b>23 voters</label> to <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E58"><b>[109]</b>the Innsbrook resort outside St. Louis</label> to help <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[111]</b>him</label> practice . </p>

<p>In 16 years in <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E60"><b>[116]</b>Congress</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[117]</b>Gore</label> held some 1,000 town meetings with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E62"><b>[119]</b>Tennessee constituents</label> , and they 've become a regular feature of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[120]</b>his</label> presidential campaign . </p>
<p>After an uncharacteristically muted demeanor in last week 's debate , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9"><b>[121]</b>Gore</label> , was looking to do better this time . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E63"><b>[122]</b>I</label> do n't think <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E64"><b>[123]</b>you</label> play it safe , '' said <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E63"><b>[125]</b>Gore 's campaign chairman</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E63"><b>[126]</b>William Daley</label> , previewing the Tuesday night encounter . </p>

<p>'' <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E4"><b>[130]</b>Bush</label> had long resisted the town-hall-style session , but in recent weeks on the campaign trail has been doing them almost daily . </p>
