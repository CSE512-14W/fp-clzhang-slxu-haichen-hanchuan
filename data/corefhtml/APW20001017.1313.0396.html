<p>Candidates-Debate </p>
<p>Gore , Bush Prepare for Final Debate </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E14">ST. LOUIS</label> <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E65">(AP)</label> _ As <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E4">Republican George W. Bush</label> and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Democrat Al Gore</label> prepared to perch on stools and take <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E72">voters</label> 0027 questions in a crucial third debate , the sudden death of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1">Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan</label> cast a pall over <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76">their</label> final meeting . </p>
<p>After talk of cancellation or a postponement for mourning , plans were made early Tuesday to continue the 9 p.m. EDT event on schedule , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E77">officials of both campaigns</label> said . </p>
<p>`` In the end , there was general agreement that <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1">Mel Carnahan</label> would have wanted <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E2">us</label> to go forward , 00270027 <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E3">a senior Bush campaign official</label> said , speaking on condition of anonymity . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E6">Bush 0027s wife</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E6">Laura</label> , canceled plans for a morning rally . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E8">Bush campaign officials</label> also decided to tone down a post-debate rally , and were even considering canceling it . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Gore</label> had n0027t planned any events before the debate . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1">Carnahan</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1">a Democrat who was running for the Senate</label> , campaigned with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Gore</label> whenever <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">the vice president</label> was in <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E11">Missouri</label> and would have accompanied <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Gore</label> aboard <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E12">Air Force II</label> to a <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E13">Kansas City</label> rally on Wednesday . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Gore</label> called <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E15">Mrs. Carnahan</label> with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">his</label> condolences after the news broke Monday night , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E17">aides</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E18">We</label> 0027re all waking up , honestly , to the tragedy and the pain of it and the shock of it , 00270027 <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E19">Democratic vice presidential candidate Joseph Lieberman</label> said Tuesday morning on CNN . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E28">The Bush and Gore campaigns</label> did not talk to <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E22">each other</label> directly about the possibility of postponement , but went through <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23">the debate commission 0027s director</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23">Janet Brown</label> , in a series of pre-dawn phone calls . </p>
<p>Eventually , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E23">Brown</label> recommended that the debate should go on , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E26">neither side</label> objected , according to <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E27">campaign officials</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E25">The commission</label> was to announce the plans later Tuesday , with <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E29">each candidate</label> given time at the debate 0027s start to say a few words about <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E1">Carnahan , who died Monday night in the crash of a small plane</label> . </p>
<p>With the larger bloc of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E31">uncommitted voters across the nation</label> apparently holding the key to the election , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76">both candidates</label> were clearly mindful of the high stakes if the encounter goes forward as planned . </p>
<p>The informal question-and-answer format is one <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">Gore</label> is comfortable with , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">he</label> promised on Monday to `` just have an open meeting , 00270027 as <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E9">he</label> had done many times before . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E4">Bush , who has less formal debate experience than the vice president but whose standing in public opinion polls rose after the first two face-offs</label> , vowed to `` just tell it like it is . </p>
<p>00270027 The debate , just three weeks before the Nov. 7 election , will be held on <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E33">the campus of Washington University</label> . </p>
<p>While <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35">the moderator</label> will be <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35">the same as in the Boston and Winston-Salem , N.C. , debates</label> _ <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E35">Jim Lehrer of PBS</label> _ questions this time will come from <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E41">the audience</label> . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E49">The result</label> was <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E49">a group of area voters who say they could support either Gore or Bush _ though they might be leaning one way or the other</label> . </p>

<p>Tuesday night 0027s debate marks the beginning of the final stretch . </p>
<p>And , with polls continuing to show the race to be neck-and-neck , any stumble could have major impact on a contest in which <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E76">both candidates</label> are fiercely wooing <label class="APW20001017.1313.0396-E55">a dwindling band of undecided voters</label> . </p>
