<p>Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23">the Gulf of Mexico</label> this summer that <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E30">some scientists</label> are talking about the potential for serious future threats to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E32">commercial and recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf</label> . </p>
<p>The jellyfish , a native species and an invading one , appeared in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E28">prime spawning areas</label> just as breeding season for many of <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23">the Gulf</label> 's most important species kicked into high gear . </p>
<p>According to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E33">the National Marine Fisheries Service</label> , the number of jellyfish in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23">the Gulf</label> has been rising for at least 13 years . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E34">Scientists</label> say the jellyfish are exploiting three major <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E35">human-induced</label> changes in the environment : <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E36">thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish</label> have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish , which need a hard surface for spawning ; nitrogen pollution from <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E37">farm</label> runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms , providing extra food for jellyfish ; and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E38">commercial fishermen</label> take great numbers of menhaden , a soft-finned , bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">Dr. Monty Graham</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama</label> , worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot help but multiply at an astonishing rate . </p>
<p>Making matters much worse , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">he</label> said , is the advent of Phyllorhiza punctata , or <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E3">Australian</label> spotted jellyfish . </p>
<p>The giant species , previously unreported in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23">the Gulf</label> , is a 25-pound bruiser of a jellyfish native to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E4">the Pacific</label> . </p>
<p>Some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E5">the Caribbean</label> . </p>
<p>This summer , after apparently riding <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E6">ocean</label> currents north , they concentrated themselves in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E7">the passes between the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the Gulf of Mexico</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E3">Australian</label> jellyfish have now mostly died off in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23">the Gulf</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E10">fishery scientists</label> worry that they may already have affected next year 's fish populations . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E12">scientists</label> say the animals were spawning prodigiously , broadcasting millions of their own eggs as they ate the eggs and larvae of native species . </p>
<p>Popular sport fish , including redfish , speckled trout , white trout and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E13">Spanish</label> mackerel , as well as commercially important species like crabs and menhaden , spawn just outside <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E8">the barrier islands</label> . </p>
<p>This year , their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E7">the jellyfish-choked passes</label> to reach <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E14">the estuaries that serve as nurseries for the baby fish</label> . </p>
<p>`` These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over , cleaning it of everything in it , '' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">Graham</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E15">We</label> 're finding them with 200 fish eggs in their guts . </p>
<p>'' The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved swimming to the surface , then diving down to the bottom , scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB pellet . </p>
<p>After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E16">scientists</label> said , the water was almost devoid of living things . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E17">You</label> really have two problems in terms of commercially important fish , '' said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18">Harriet M. Perry</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18">director of the fisheries section of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi</label> . </p>
<p>`` First the jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially important species , and then the fish larvae must compete with these incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18">Perry</label> said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18">she</label> worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent residents . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">Graham</label> said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">he</label> feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39">He</label> noted , though , that the newcomers represented a small threat compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still swarming offshore below <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E2">Alabama</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E22">Mississippi</label> and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E24">Louisiana</label> in a huge swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide . </p>
<p>It is these jellyfish that worry <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25">Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25">a larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25">Lyczkowski-Shultz</label> said the long-term picture might be bleak if the jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace . </p>
<p>`` It could be totally devastating , '' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25">she</label> said . </p>
