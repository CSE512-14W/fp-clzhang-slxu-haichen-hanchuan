<p>Swarms of jellyfish consumed so many fish eggs and larvae in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23"><b>[0]</b>the Gulf of Mexico</label> this summer that <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E30"><b>[1]</b>some scientists</label> are talking about the potential for serious future threats to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E32"><b>[2]</b>commercial and recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf</label> . </p>
<p>The jellyfish , a native species and an invading one , appeared in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E28"><b>[4]</b>prime spawning areas</label> just as breeding season for many of <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23"><b>[5]</b>the Gulf</label> 's most important species kicked into high gear . </p>
<p>According to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E33"><b>[6]</b>the National Marine Fisheries Service</label> , the number of jellyfish in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23"><b>[7]</b>the Gulf</label> has been rising for at least 13 years . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E34"><b>[8]</b>Scientists</label> say the jellyfish are exploiting three major <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E35"><b>[9]</b>human-induced</label> changes in the environment : <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E36"><b>[10]</b>thousands of oil rigs and artificial reefs established to attract game fish</label> have greatly increased the breeding habitat for jellyfish , which need a hard surface for spawning ; nitrogen pollution from <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E37"><b>[11]</b>farm</label> runoff and industrial sources feeds plankton blooms , providing extra food for jellyfish ; and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E38"><b>[12]</b>commercial fishermen</label> take great numbers of menhaden , a soft-finned , bony fish that competes with jellyfish for the plankton . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[14]</b>Dr. Monty Graham</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[15]</b>a researcher at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama</label> , worries that with all these advantages jellyfish cannot help but multiply at an astonishing rate . </p>
<p>Making matters much worse , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[18]</b>he</label> said , is the advent of Phyllorhiza punctata , or <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E3"><b>[19]</b>Australian</label> spotted jellyfish . </p>
<p>The giant species , previously unreported in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23"><b>[20]</b>the Gulf</label> , is a 25-pound bruiser of a jellyfish native to <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E4"><b>[21]</b>the Pacific</label> . </p>
<p>Some time ago the basketball-size jellyfish established themselves in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E5"><b>[22]</b>the Caribbean</label> . </p>
<p>This summer , after apparently riding <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E6"><b>[23]</b>ocean</label> currents north , they concentrated themselves in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E7"><b>[24]</b>the passes between the barrier islands that separate the Mississippi Sound from the Gulf of Mexico</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E3"><b>[29]</b>Australian</label> jellyfish have now mostly died off in <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E23"><b>[30]</b>the Gulf</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E10"><b>[32]</b>fishery scientists</label> worry that they may already have affected next year 's fish populations . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E12"><b>[33]</b>scientists</label> say the animals were spawning prodigiously , broadcasting millions of their own eggs as they ate the eggs and larvae of native species . </p>
<p>Popular sport fish , including redfish , speckled trout , white trout and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E13"><b>[34]</b>Spanish</label> mackerel , as well as commercially important species like crabs and menhaden , spawn just outside <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E8"><b>[35]</b>the barrier islands</label> . </p>
<p>This year , their eggs and larvae had to drift with tidal currents through <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E7"><b>[36]</b>the jellyfish-choked passes</label> to reach <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E14"><b>[37]</b>the estuaries that serve as nurseries for the baby fish</label> . </p>
<p>`` These things are incredibly efficient at turning the water over , cleaning it of everything in it , '' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[39]</b>Graham</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E15"><b>[40]</b>We</label> 're finding them with 200 fish eggs in their guts . </p>
<p>'' The newcomers had a frighteningly effective feeding pattern that involved swimming to the surface , then diving down to the bottom , scouring the water of virtually every living thing smaller than a BB pellet . </p>
<p>After flowing through the jellyfish gantlet , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E16"><b>[41]</b>scientists</label> said , the water was almost devoid of living things . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E17"><b>[42]</b>You</label> really have two problems in terms of commercially important fish , '' said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18"><b>[43]</b>Harriet M. Perry</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18"><b>[44]</b>director of the fisheries section of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Mississippi</label> . </p>
<p>`` First the jellies are ingesting the larvae and eggs of these commercially important species , and then the fish larvae must compete with these incredibly efficient jellies for the same food source . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18"><b>[49]</b>Perry</label> said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E18"><b>[50]</b>she</label> worried that the Phyllorhiza might become permanent residents . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[51]</b>Graham</label> said <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[52]</b>he</label> feared that their offspring might appear in larger numbers next spring . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E39"><b>[53]</b>He</label> noted , though , that the newcomers represented a small threat compared with the monstrous herds of native moon jellyfish still swarming offshore below <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E2"><b>[54]</b>Alabama</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E22"><b>[55]</b>Mississippi</label> and <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E24"><b>[56]</b>Louisiana</label> in a huge swath roughly 100 miles long and 30 miles wide . </p>
<p>It is these jellyfish that worry <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25"><b>[58]</b>Dr. Joanne Lyczkowski-Shultz</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25"><b>[59]</b>a larval specialist with the National Marine Fisheries Service</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25"><b>[61]</b>Lyczkowski-Shultz</label> said the long-term picture might be bleak if the jellyfish populations continued to grow at their current pace . </p>
<p>`` It could be totally devastating , '' <label class="NYT20001002.1754.0290-E25"><b>[62]</b>she</label> said . </p>
