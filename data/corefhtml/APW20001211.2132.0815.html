<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E21"><b>[0]</b>BOSTON</label> <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E32"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[2]</b>Major League Soccer</label> scored a victory over <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[3]</b>its players</label> on Monday when <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[4]</b>a jury</label> decided that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[5]</b>the league</label> was not <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E36"><b>[6]</b>a monopoly with the power to depress salaries</label> . </p>
<p>The class-action antitrust lawsuit filed in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E37"><b>[7]</b>federal court</label> claimed that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39"><b>[8]</b>MLS owners</label> conspired with <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E40"><b>[9]</b>the U.S. Soccer Federation</label> to eliminate competition for <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E41"><b>[10]</b>Division I soccer players</label> . </p>
<p>But after about a day of deliberation , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[11]</b>the jury</label> found that plenty of competition existed _ in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E42"><b>[12]</b>Europe</label> , in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E1"><b>[13]</b>Latin America</label> , and in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E2"><b>[14]</b>minor and indoor leagues in the United States</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[15]</b>We</label> could n't have told <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[16]</b>the players</label> , 'Take it or leave it , ' because <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[17]</b>they</label> had other places to go , '' said <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E4"><b>[18]</b>Michael Cardozo</label> , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E4"><b>[19]</b>an attorney for MLS</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[20]</b>The players</label> will appeal the verdict , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E6"><b>[21]</b>attorney Jeffrey Kessler</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[22]</b>Jurors</label> told <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E32"><b>[23]</b>The Associated Press</label> that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[24]</b>they</label> were impressed by the testimony of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E8"><b>[25]</b>former deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati , who compiled a chart noting that MLS players had come from and gone to professional leagues in dozens of other countries</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[26]</b>the players</label> argued that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E13"><b>[27]</b>only 20 percent of MLS players</label> had international options . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E15"><b>[28]</b>Others</label> were turned away because of visa and work-permit requirements or other limits on the use of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E16"><b>[29]</b>foreign players</label> . </p>
<p>`` All <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[30]</b>we</label> want is an agreement between labor and management , '' said <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17"><b>[31]</b>Garth Lagerway</label> , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17"><b>[32]</b>the Miami Fusion goalkeeper</label> and <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17"><b>[33]</b>player representative</label> . </p>
<p>`` All that 's happened in the history of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[34]</b>this league</label> is <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[35]</b>the league</label> telling <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[36]</b>us</label> what <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[37]</b>we</label> had to accept . </p>
<p>'' Because <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[38]</b>the jury</label> sided with <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39"><b>[39]</b>the owners</label> that the market was not limited to Division I soccer in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3"><b>[40]</b>this country</label> , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[41]</b>it</label> did not have to answer any of the other questions . </p>
<p>At the heart of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[42]</b>the players</label> ' case was the claim that , if not for the exclusion of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E22"><b>[43]</b>other Division I leagues</label> , there could be a thriving marketplace for <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E23"><b>[44]</b>soccer leagues</label> and <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E24"><b>[45]</b>players</label> in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3"><b>[46]</b>this country</label> . </p>
<p>However , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[47]</b>the jury</label> found that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25"><b>[48]</b>two topflight leagues</label> would oversaturate the limited <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3"><b>[49]</b>American</label> interest in the sport . </p>
<p>`` It was <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[50]</b>our</label> feeling that if <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25"><b>[51]</b>these two leagues</label> had been in place , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25"><b>[52]</b>both</label> would be bankrupt , '' <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E27"><b>[53]</b>juror Tina Hart</label> told <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E32"><b>[54]</b>the AP</label> . </p>
<p>`` There is n't enough demand for it . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39"><b>[55]</b>MLS owners</label> claimed that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39"><b>[56]</b>they</label> have lost $ 250 million since 1995 , even without competition . </p>
<p>A decision against <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39"><b>[57]</b>them</label> would have been tripled under antitrust law and then applied to <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E29"><b>[58]</b>other players in the class</label> , which could have put it into the tens of millions of dollars . </p>
<p>The case had been closely watched at the start when <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[59]</b>players</label> claimed that the `` single-entity '' structure of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[60]</b>the league</label> _ a centralized ownership mimicked by <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E31"><b>[61]</b>every new sports league formed since MLS</label> _ was itself an antitrust violation . </p>
<p>That claim was thrown out before trial . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E6"><b>[62]</b>Kessler</label> said it would be appealed , along with <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[63]</b>this jury</label> 's verdict . </p>
<p>But Monday 's decision is a setback for <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19"><b>[64]</b>the players in that case</label> as well . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33"><b>[65]</b>The league</label> has argued that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35"><b>[66]</b>the jury</label> 's definition of the market will apply to _ and undercut _ that case as well . </p>
