<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">Jurors</label> told <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E32">The Associated Press</label> that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">they</label> were impressed by the testimony of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E8">former deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati , who compiled a chart noting that MLS players had come from and gone to professional leagues in dozens of other countries</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">the players</label> argued that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E13">only 20 percent of MLS players</label> had international options . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E15">Others</label> were turned away because of visa and work-permit requirements or other limits on the use of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E16">foreign players</label> . </p>
<p>`` All <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">we</label> want is an agreement between labor and management , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17">Garth Lagerway</label> , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17">the Miami Fusion goalkeeper</label> and <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E17">player representative</label> . </p>
<p>`` All that 0027s happened in the history of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33">this league</label> is <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33">the league</label> telling <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">us</label> what <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">we</label> had to accept . </p>
<p>00270027 Because <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">the jury</label> sided with <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39">the owners</label> that the market was not limited to Division I soccer in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3">this country</label> , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">it</label> did not have to answer any of the other questions . </p>
<p>At the heart of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">the players</label> 0027 case was the claim that , if not for the exclusion of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E22">other Division I leagues</label> , there could be a thriving marketplace for <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E23">soccer leagues</label> and <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E24">players</label> in <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3">this country</label> . </p>
<p>However , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">the jury</label> found that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25">two topflight leagues</label> would oversaturate the limited <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E3">American</label> interest in the sport . </p>
<p>`` It was <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">our</label> feeling that if <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25">these two leagues</label> had been in place , <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E25">both</label> would be bankrupt , 00270027 <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E27">juror Tina Hart</label> told <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E32">the AP</label> . </p>
<p>`` There is n0027t enough demand for it . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39">MLS owners</label> claimed that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39">they</label> have lost $ 250 million since 1995 , even without competition . </p>
<p>A decision against <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E39">them</label> would have been tripled under antitrust law and then applied to <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E29">other players in the class</label> , which could have put it into the tens of millions of dollars . </p>
<p>The case had been closely watched at the start when <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">players</label> claimed that the `` single-entity 00270027 structure of <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33">the league</label> _ a centralized ownership mimicked by <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E31">every new sports league formed since MLS</label> _ was itself an antitrust violation . </p>
<p>That claim was thrown out before trial . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E6">Kessler</label> said it would be appealed , along with <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">this jury</label> 0027s verdict . </p>
<p>But Monday 0027s decision is a setback for <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E19">the players in that case</label> as well . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E33">The league</label> has argued that <label class="APW20001211.2132.0815-E35">the jury</label> 0027s definition of the market will apply to _ and undercut _ that case as well . </p>
