<p><label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[4]</b>Shenson , who was born in San Francisco</label> , was working in <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E2"><b>[5]</b>London</label> as <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[6]</b>a film producer _ most notably of `` The Mouse That Roared , '' with Peter Sellers</label> _ when <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[7]</b>he</label> was approached by <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[8]</b>United Artists</label> to oversee the first foray into cinema by <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[9]</b>the Beatles</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[10]</b>The studio</label> had discovered that the recording contract between <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[11]</b>the Beatles</label> and <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E5"><b>[12]</b>EMI</label> did not cover film soundtracks . </p>
<p>Although <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[13]</b>the Beatles</label> had yet to tour <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E6"><b>[14]</b>the United States</label> , <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[15]</b>the group</label> 's popularity in <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E8"><b>[16]</b>Britain</label> was phenomenal , and <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[17]</b>United Artists</label> decided to exploit it by putting out a cheaply made film as a pretext for a soundtrack album . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[18]</b>He</label> hired <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E9"><b>[19]</b>Richard Lester</label> , <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E9"><b>[20]</b>a fellow American</label> , to direct . </p>
<p>At the suggestion of <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E11"><b>[21]</b>Paul McCartney</label> , <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[22]</b>he</label> recruited <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E12"><b>[23]</b>the Liverpool-based playwright</label> <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E12"><b>[24]</b>Alun Owen</label> to write the screenplay . </p>
<p>The film 's prospects were so little regarded that while <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[25]</b>Shenson</label> was prepared to offer <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[26]</b>the Beatles</label> 25 percent of the net income , <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E15"><b>[27]</b>the band 's manager</label> , <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E15"><b>[28]</b>Brian Epstein</label> , initially asked for only 7 percent . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[29]</b>United Artists</label> thought that <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[30]</b>the Beatles</label> would be a short-lived phenomenon , but <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[31]</b>Shenson</label> foresaw <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[32]</b>their</label> staying power and struck an agreement with <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[33]</b>the studio</label> that all rights to the film would revert to <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[34]</b>him</label> after 15 years . </p>
<p>`` A Hard Day 's Night '' was so popular that <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[35]</b>Shenson</label> said <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[36]</b>the studio</label> recouped what <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E4"><b>[37]</b>it</label> spent on the production _ about $ 600,000 _ in just one day after the film 's release in 1964 . </p>
<p>A reissue of the film is to appear in theaters later this year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[38]</b>Shenson</label> was on the set every day , and after <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[39]</b>he</label> had looked at some early rushes <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E17"><b>[40]</b>his wife</label> asked <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[41]</b>him</label> whether <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[42]</b>the Beatles</label> could act. `` <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[43]</b>I</label> do n't know if <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[44]</b>they</label> can act , '' <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E7"><b>[45]</b>he</label> replied , `` but <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E18"><b>[46]</b>you</label> ca n't keep <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E18"><b>[47]</b>your</label> eyes off <label class="NYT20001103.2226.0443-E28"><b>[48]</b>them</label> . </p>
