<p>WORLD ' & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; By STUART ELLIOTT & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; </p>
<p>It 's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising , marketing and <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E29"><b>[0]</b>the media</label> . </p>
<p>_ Will <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E62"><b>[1]</b>Americans</label> ever refer to the day before Thanksgiving as `` Thanksgiving Wednesday , '' as <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E63"><b>[2]</b>ABC</label> did repeatedly this week in commercials promoting <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E63"><b>[3]</b>its</label> Wednesday sitcoms `` The Drew Carey Show '' and `` Spin City '' ? </p>
<p>_ If <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E64"><b>[4]</b>a Hollywood studio</label> makes a movie about the <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E66"><b>[5]</b>Florida</label> election standoff , would the title be `` It 's a Chad , Chad , Chad , Chad World '' ? </p>
<p>_ <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E67"><b>[6]</b>How many readers of The Wall Street Journal</label> noticed that an article on Wednesday carrying the headline `` Genetically Altered Protein Is Found in Still More Corn '' ran adjacent to an advertisement for a golf tournament on <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E68"><b>[7]</b>Fox Sports</label> sponsored by <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E69"><b>[8]</b>Sun Microsystems</label> that featured a fanciful photograph of a gigantic ear of corn as big as <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E70"><b>[9]</b>a Buick</label> ? </p>
<p>_ Does n't a new television commercial for <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E71"><b>[10]</b>Fidelity Investments</label> , centered on a telephone conversation between <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E72"><b>[11]</b>a female employee</label> and <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E73"><b>[12]</b>a male customer</label> , resemble a <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E74"><b>[13]</b>Citibank</label> campaign from the late 1980s that was so brilliantly parodied as the `` First Citiwide Change Bank '' commercials on `` Saturday Night Live '' ? </p>
<p>_ Did <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E1"><b>[14]</b>shoppers at the New York supermarket chain Gristede 's</label> rush to take advantage of a recent sale on the `` BIG 150-count box '' of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E5"><b>[15]</b>Scotties</label> facial tissues , or did they recall that <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E5"><b>[16]</b>Scotties</label> has usually come in a 175-count box ? </p>
<p>_ Can <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E7"><b>[17]</b>Ocean Spray Cranberries</label> get a refund on a full-page ad that ran in newspapers on Nov. 8 and carried the headline `` Now That the Election Is Over , You Can Focus on Some Real News '' ? </p>
<p>_ Was it a coincidence that an ad for the <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E8"><b>[18]</b>Carnation Coffee-mate</label> line of coffee creamers in the recent issue of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E9"><b>[19]</b>In Style Entertaining 2000 magazine</label> ran opposite an article about `` great trends '' in party-giving that began by describing carnations as `` the chic flower of the moment '' ? </p>
<p>_ Should <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E10"><b>[20]</b>an English teacher</label> have been consulted before <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E11"><b>[21]</b>the Tropicana division of PepsiCo</label> produced posters that described <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E11"><b>[22]</b>its</label> Pure Premium orange juice as being `` as packed with Vitamin C as <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E37"><b>[23]</b>a bus</label> on a rainy day '' ? </p>
<p>_ Will <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E14"><b>[24]</b>Jack Nicholson</label> , <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E15"><b>[25]</b>Helen Hunt</label> , <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E16"><b>[26]</b>Greg Kinnear</label> and <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E17"><b>[27]</b>James L. Brooks</label> complain about an ad from <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E18"><b>[28]</b>Campbell Soup Co.</label> for <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E18"><b>[29]</b>Campbell</label> 's Cream of Mushroom soup that carried the slogan `` As m 'm ! </p>
<p>m 'm ! </p>
<p>good ! </p>
<p>as it gets '' ? </p>
<p>_ Now that <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E19"><b>[30]</b>the Roundabout Theater Company</label> is calling <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E20"><b>[31]</b>its new facility in Times Square</label> <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E20"><b>[32]</b>the American Airlines Theater</label> , will <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E22"><b>[33]</b>the ushers</label> give out peanuts instead of Playbills ? </p>
<p>_ Why did <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E23"><b>[34]</b>the Reader 's Digest Association</label> go to the trouble of airbrushing the identifying information from a label on a pair of jeans worn by <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E24"><b>[35]</b>a man in a photograph featured in an ad for Reader 's Digest magazine</label> , but leave the red tab on the back pocket that tells everyone the pants are <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E60"><b>[36]</b>Levi</label> 's ? </p>
<p>_ Do television commercials for prescription drugs disclose that side effects in tests were no worse `` than a sugar pill '' because research found that <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E26"><b>[37]</b>consumers</label> were n't familiar with the word `` placebo '' ? </p>
<p>_ What was in the zeitgeist that led <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E27"><b>[38]</b>two disparate advertisers</label> _ <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E30"><b>[39]</b>Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield</label> and <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E31"><b>[40]</b>the MSN network of Microsoft</label> _ to introduce about the same time campaigns centered on butterflies ? </p>
<p>_ And what was in the zeitgeist that led <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E33"><b>[41]</b>two automotive marketers</label> _ <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E35"><b>[42]</b>Land Rover</label> and <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E36"><b>[43]</b>Volvo</label> _ to introduce about the same time commercials centered on <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E38"><b>[44]</b>drivers rescuing animals on rainy roads</label> ? </p>
<p>_ Are <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E39"><b>[45]</b>folks</label> old enough to remember the heyday of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E40"><b>[46]</b>the radio and television personality</label> <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E40"><b>[47]</b>Arthur Godfrey</label> reminded of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E40"><b>[48]</b>his</label> longtime greeting , `` How are <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E42"><b>[49]</b>ya</label> ? </p>

<p>_ How appealing was a recent offer made by <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E46"><b>[53]</b>Sprint Communications Co.</label> to give <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E47"><b>[54]</b>buyers of a Sprint PCS telephone and a calling plan</label> a free `` pre-owned phone '' ? </p>
<p>_ Was it an inside joke that the name of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E50"><b>[55]</b>the character played by John Corbett on `` Sex and the City</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E50"><b>[56]</b>Aidan Shaw</label> , was almost identical to the name of <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E52"><b>[57]</b>a longtime star of gay sex films</label> , <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E52"><b>[58]</b>Aiden Shaw</label> ? </p>
<p>_ How many tickets did <label class="NYT20001123.1511.0062-E54"><b>[59]</b>the Houston Grand Opera</label> sell after mailing out a promotional brochure featuring photographs of cattle with headlines like `` It 's udderly fantastic entertainment ! </p>
<p>'' and `` Great opera . </p>
