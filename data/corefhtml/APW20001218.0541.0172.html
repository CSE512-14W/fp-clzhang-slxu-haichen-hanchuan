<p>While <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E8">Bush</label> v. <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">Gore</label> ended <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">Al Gore</label> 0027s quest for <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E58">the White House</label> and effectively made <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E8">George W.

<p>And its implications for the future of the electoral process can only be guessed at . </p>
<p>Two hundred years ago , shoehorned into cramped quarters in <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E14">this city 0027s new Capitol</label> , intervening in a disputed <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E6">presidential</label> election was not a likely option for <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">a court still finding its constitutional role</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E6">Presidents</label> sought instead to shape <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> to buttress <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E6">their</label> often-conflicting views of the course <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E2">the young republic</label> should follow . </p>
<p>By flickering candlelight , in the last hours of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E16">his administration</label> , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E15">President John Adams</label> appointed <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E18">members of his Federalist Party to federal judgeships</label> , hoping <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E18">they</label> would control the much-feared `` radical 00270027 notions of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E21">Thomas Jefferson</label> and <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E22">his political allies</label> . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E20">The Federalists</label> `` retreated into the judiciary as a stronghold , the tenure of which renders it difficult to dislodge <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E18">them</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E21">Jefferson</label> wrote soon after <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E21">his</label> 1801 inauguration . </p>

<p>Three years later , in <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E27">Marbury</label> v. <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E28">Madison</label> , a case growing out of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E15">Adams</label> 0027 last-minute judicial appointments , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E23">Marshall</label> established <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> 0027s power to `` say what the law is . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E23">Marshall</label> declared the supremacy of the Constitution over any law passed by <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E3">Congress</label> . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">The court</label> has always moved cautiously . </p>

<p>Moving to refashion <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> to suit <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E30">their</label> own views , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E30">Jefferson 0027s friends in Congress</label> impeached <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E31">Justice Samuel Chase</label> in 1804 , just months after <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E31">he</label> and <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E33">his colleagues</label> had declared that an act of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E3">Congress</label> violated the Constitution . </p>
<p>The attempt to weaken <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> 0027s freedom of action collapsed when <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E31">Chase</label> was acquitted after a trial in <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E34">the Senate</label> . </p>
<p>Other bids to curb the power of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> or to influence <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">its</label> decisions by <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E35">appointments to its bench</label> have been relatively commonplace . </p>

<p>At times , however , posterity has judged <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">it</label> to have been on the wrong side of history . </p>
<p>In the <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E42">Dred Scott</label> case of 1857 , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> under <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E43">Chief Justice Roger B.

<p>By the mid-20th century , politics represented the one major area where <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> was reluctant to intervene . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E49">Courts</label> ought not to enter this political thicket , 00270027 <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E50">Justice Felix Frankfurter</label> wrote . </p>
<p>In 1946 , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E52">the nine justices</label> dismissed a case involving the apportionment of <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E3">congressional</label> districts . </p>
<p>That view would slowly change . </p>
<p>In 1962 , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> abandoned <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">its</label> caution . </p>
<p>Finding remedies to the unequal distribution of political power was indeed within <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">its</label> constitutional authority . </p>
<p>Although <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E53">Supreme Court justices</label> were named to <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E54">the congressionally appointed electoral commission that examined the deadlocked 1876 presidential election</label> , it was not until <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E8">Bush</label> v. <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">Gore</label> that <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">itself</label> weighed the remedies in a disputed <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E6">presidential</label> election . </p>
<p>Although the decision will be long debated , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> 0027s word and authority was final . </p>
<p>`` Let there be no doubt , while <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">I</label> strongly disagree with <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E1">the court</label> 0027s decision , <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">I</label> accept it , 00270027 <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E9">Gore</label> told <label class="APW20001218.0541.0172-E2">the nation</label> . </p>
