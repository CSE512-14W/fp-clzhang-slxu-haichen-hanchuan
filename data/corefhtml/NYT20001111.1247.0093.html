<p>`` <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E67"><b>[4]</b>I</label> hope it will reduce the violence and bring back reason to <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E94"><b>[5]</b>this area</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E67"><b>[6]</b>Maj.

<p>Instead , it has touched off one of the bloodiest and most intense weekends of fighting yet in the six-week-old conflict , with gunfire crackling through the <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E97"><b>[11]</b>West Bank</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E6"><b>[12]</b>Gaza Strip</label> . </p>

<p>Indeed , the escalation of gunfire is being described by both <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E13"><b>[21]</b>Palestinians</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E14"><b>[22]</b>Israelis</label> as a `` Lebanonization '' of the conflict to a state resembling guerrilla war . </p>

<p>The situation remained tense as dusk fell , with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E26"><b>[34]</b>an army helicopter</label> hovering overhead as <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E27"><b>[35]</b>Palestinian police</label> evacuated <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28"><b>[36]</b>their post</label> for fear <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28"><b>[37]</b>it</label> would be attacked by <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E29"><b>[38]</b>rockets</label> . </p>
