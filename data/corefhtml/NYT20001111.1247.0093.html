Yitzhak Eitan</label> told <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E103">reporters</label> at a briefing hours after <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E104">three missiles fired from an Apache helicopter</label> killed <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E66">Hussein Obaiyat</label> , along with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E1">two middle-aged women standing near his van in Beit Sahur , near Bethlehem</label> . </p>
<p>Instead , it has touched off one of the bloodiest and most intense weekends of fighting yet in the six-week-old conflict , with gunfire crackling through the <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E97">West Bank</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E6">Gaza Strip</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E7">Five Palestinians</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E8">an Israeli soldier</label> were shot dead on Friday . </p>
<p>Gunfire between <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E9">Palestinian positions</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E10">Israeli areas</label> continued through the night around <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E100">Ramallah</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E4">Bethlehem</label> , and by nightfall on Saturday <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E11">more Palestinians</label> were dead and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E12">an Israeli soldier</label> critically wounded , raising the death toll to at least 200 . </p>
<p>Indeed , the escalation of gunfire is being described by both <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E13">Palestinians</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E14">Israelis</label> as a `` Lebanonization 00270027 of the conflict to a state resembling guerrilla war . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E15">Two Palestinians</label> were killed as <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E15">they</label> staged a drive-by ambush on <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E16">an Israeli jeep in the Gaza Strip near the Israeli settlement of Gush Katif</label> Saturday afternoon , and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E18">two Israeli soldiers</label> were wounded , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E19">one</label> critically . </p>
<p>As <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E20">the Israelis</label> retrieved and held on to <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E15">the two bodies</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E21">a large crowd of Palestinians</label> gathered . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E22">Men in civilian clothes in the crowd</label> began firing with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E24">AK-47 assault rifles</label> and a 45-minute <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E95">gun</label> battle broke out . </p>
<p>The situation remained tense as dusk fell , with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E26">an army helicopter</label> hovering overhead as <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E27">Palestinian police</label> evacuated <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28">their post</label> for fear <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28">it</label> would be attacked by <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E29">rockets</label> . </p>
<p>The clashes started early in <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E6">Gaza</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E30">A 12-year-old Palestinian boy</label> was shot dead when <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E31">troops</label> opened fire on <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E32">a crowd of stone throwers near the Erez checkpoint</label> . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E36">Jenin , on the West Bank</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E37">a Palestinian identified as Hani Marzouq , 37</label> , died in <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E39">a hospital</label> from neck and chest wounds suffered in the widespread clashes on Friday . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E53">The Palestinians</label> charge that the shooting was an attempt to assassinate <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E54">a Palestinian official</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E55">The army</label> issued a statement saying <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E55">it</label> `` denies any attempt to assassinate <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E56">a Fatah member</label> or <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E57">a senior official of the Palestinian authority</label> . </p>

<p>The assassination of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E66">the once-relatively obscure Fatah leader</label> <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E66">Obaiyat</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E66">whom</label> <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E55">the army</label> blamed particularly for leading nocturnal shooting on <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E68">Gilo</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E68">a neighborhood in southeastern Jerusalem</label> , was regarded as a grave step by <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E71">Israeli commentators</label> . </p>
<p>Writing in the newspaper Haaretz before Friday 0027s marked increase in <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E58">Palestinian</label> gunfire , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E72">Amir Oren</label> described the strike as `` a critical point , almost a point of no return , in the scale of violence . </p>
<p>00270027 In Yedioth Ahronoth , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E73">Roni Shaked</label> wrote : `` The use of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E74">helicopter missiles</label> as a tool of assassination is a step on the way to the ` Lebanonization 0027 of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E75">the territories</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E73">Shaked</label> added : `` In the short term _ and this was also the assessment of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E76">the General Staff</label> _ <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E77">the Palestinians</label> will step up <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E77">their</label> hostilities in response to the slaying . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E55">the army</label> believes in the long run such proactive operations will lead to a decrease in terrorism . </p>
<p>00270027 The surge in violence came as <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E78">Prime Minister Ehud Barak</label> prepared for a meeting on Sunday with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E80">President Clinton</label> in <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E82">Washington</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E83">no one here</label> seemed to be holding out hopes that the meeting would bring calm soon . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E78">Barak</label> said on Friday , before much of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84">Israel</label> closed down for the Sabbath , that the talks would be an effort to end the violence , but added <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E78">he</label> did not expect they would `` lead to a renewal of negotiations . </p>
<p>00270027 With the seven-year-old peace process in tatters , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E85">one senior Palestinian figure</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E85">Parliament speaker Ahmed Korei , known as Abu Ala</label> , insisted that <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84">Israel</label> must halt all settlement building , accept an international peacekeeping force to protect <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E88">Palestinians</label> and allow <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E89">the United Nations</label> a role in the peace process , before talks could be resumed . </p>
<p>These are conditions that are anathema to <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84">the Israelis</label> and are unlikely to be met . </p>
