<p>Instead , it has touched off one of the bloodiest and most intense weekends of fighting yet in the six-week-old conflict , with gunfire crackling through the <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E97"><b>[23]</b>West Bank</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E6"><b>[24]</b>Gaza Strip</label> . </p>

<p>Indeed , the escalation of gunfire is being described by both <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E13"><b>[37]</b>Palestinians</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E14"><b>[38]</b>Israelis</label> as a `` Lebanonization '' of the conflict to a state resembling guerrilla war . </p>

<p>The situation remained tense as dusk fell , with <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E26"><b>[59]</b>an army helicopter</label> hovering overhead as <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E27"><b>[61]</b>Palestinian police</label> evacuated <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28"><b>[63]</b>their post</label> for fear <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E28"><b>[64]</b>it</label> would be attacked by <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E29"><b>[65]</b>rockets</label> . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E78"><b>[155]</b>Barak</label> said on Friday , before much of <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84"><b>[156]</b>Israel</label> closed down for the Sabbath , that the talks would be an effort to end the violence , but added <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E78"><b>[157]</b>he</label> did not expect they would `` lead to a renewal of negotiations . </p>
<p>'' With the seven-year-old peace process in tatters , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E85"><b>[159]</b>one senior Palestinian figure</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E85"><b>[162]</b>Parliament speaker Ahmed Korei , known as Abu Ala</label> , insisted that <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84"><b>[164]</b>Israel</label> must halt all settlement building , accept an international peacekeeping force to protect <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E88"><b>[165]</b>Palestinians</label> and allow <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E89"><b>[166]</b>the United Nations</label> a role in the peace process , before talks could be resumed . </p>
<p>These are conditions that are anathema to <label class="NYT20001111.1247.0093-E84"><b>[167]</b>the Israelis</label> and are unlikely to be met . </p>
