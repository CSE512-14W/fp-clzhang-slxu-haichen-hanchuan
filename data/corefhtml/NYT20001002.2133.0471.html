<p>If <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Barry Bonds</label> is voted <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">the Most Valuable Player in the National League this year</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> will be <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">the first major leaguer to win it four times</label> . </p>
<p>And with career totals of 494 homers and 471 stolen bases , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">the San Francisco Giants 0027 left fielder</label> , is <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">the only player in baseball history with more than 400 in each category</label> . </p>

<p>When the season ended Sunday , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> had batted .306 , crashed a career-high 49 home runs and driven in 106 runs . </p>
<p>But over 23 postseason games in <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> career _ 20 with <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E21">the Pirates</label> nearly a decade ago in three losing National League Championship Series and three with <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E9">the Giants</label> in a 1997 division series sweep by <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E23">the Florida Marlins</label> _ <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> has batted only .200 ( 16 for 80 ) with only one home run , only four doubles , only five runs batted in and 16 strikeouts . </p>
<p>In those three NL Championship Series , two against <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E24">the Atlanta Braves</label> ( in which he batted .148 in 1991 and .261 in 002792 ) and one against <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E25">the Cincinnati Reds</label> ( .167 in 002790 ) , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> overall average was .191 . </p>
<p>Even with <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> overall .200 postseason average , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> has not even hit <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> weight , 210 . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E26">his team , whether the Pirates or the Giants</label> , has lost 15 of those 23 postseason games . </p>
<p>Over a short postseason series , even <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E27">the best hitters</label> sometimes wallow through a slump as <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E28">their team</label> loses . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E29">Babe Ruth</label> batted .118 ( two for 17 ) in the five-game 1922 World Series that <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E30">the Yankees</label> lost to <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E9">the New York Giants</label> . </p>
<p>But over 23 postseason games , the cream is supposed to rise to the top . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> 0027 cream has only curdled . </p>
<p>To <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> dismay . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">I</label> want people to say , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> has often proclaimed , `` that <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Barry Bonds</label> is <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">the best baseball player</label> there is . </p>

<p>In 10 years of <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E61">MVP</label> voting in the 002790s , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> received the most points _ 1,895 , nearly 500 more than <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E42">the next highest vote-getter</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E42">Frank Thomas of the Chicago White Sox</label> . </p>
<p>By rule , the <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E61">MVP</label> votes must be cast in the brief interlude between the end of the regular season and the start of the playoffs . </p>
<p>So <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> 0027 postseason flops never counted against <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E61">MVP</label> credentials . </p>
<p>Those <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E61">MVP</label> votes were a tribute to the integrity of <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E45">baseball writers who cast those votes</label> ; few , if any , find <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">Bonds</label> to be endearing or charming . </p>
<p>For that matter , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E46">few of his teammates</label> have enjoyed <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> arrogant , haughty personality . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E48">I</label> 0027d rather lose without <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">him</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E48">one of his Pirate teammates</label> said , requesting anonymity , `` than win with <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">him</label> . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E50">Many of his Giant teammates</label> hardly talk to <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">him</label> . </p>
<p>Or want to . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E52">the Giants 0027 spacious clubhouse at their new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco</label> , <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> prefers to be alone . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">He</label> sprawls in a recliner and watches <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> own television set or listens to <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> stereo . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E54">Some people</label> accuse <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">me</label> of having a chip on <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">my</label> shoulder , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> once said , `` but that 0027s part of what makes <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">me</label> tick . </p>

<p>If <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">he</label> does swing at those pitches , that should be to <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E11">the Mets</label> 0027 advantage , not <label class="NYT20001002.2133.0471-E1">his</label> . </p>
