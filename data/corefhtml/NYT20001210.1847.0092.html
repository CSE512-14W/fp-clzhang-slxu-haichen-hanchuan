<p>THIS HAND COUNT ENDED IN A TIE , WITHOUT THE LAWYERS OR TV </p>
<p>REPORTERS 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; 0026 UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service 0026 QC ; 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">FIFE LAKE , Mich.</label> _ There are <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E52">no teams of lawyers</label> in <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">this sleepy little hamlet</label> . </p>
<p>There are <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E53">no television anchors</label> standing on <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E54">courthouse</label> steps chattering endlessly about the latest twist in the election dispute . </p>
<p>There is an election dispute , a tie vote as a matter of fact . </p>
<p>And just as in <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E55">Florida</label> , votes have been recounted by hand , but <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E56">the chief executive</label> 0027s race remains unsettled . </p>
<p>But that 0027s where any comparison between <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E55">Florida</label> and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">this former logging town 250 miles north of Detroit</label> ends . </p>
<p>They have counted all the votes for <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E58">Fife Lake Township supervisor</label> three times , twice on election night and once in a hand recount on Dec. 1. The result is 297 votes each for <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">the incumbent</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Dave Stremlow</label> , and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">the Republican challenger</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Toni Larson</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E3">Nobody</label> has said a word about a <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E4">court</label> challenge or another recount . </p>
<p>And the simple solution laid out in <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E5">Michigan</label> law will be followed Monday morning <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E6">up the road a few miles at the county building in Traverse City</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E6">There</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E10">Grand Traverse County Clerk Linda Coburn</label> will hold a box with two folded slips of paper , one marked `` elected 00270027 and one marked `` not elected . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E12">The candidates</label> will draw . </p>
<p>The slips of paper will be read . </p>
<p>And the race will be over . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">I</label> 0027m speechless , no matter how <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">I</label> look at it , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Larson</label> , adding that <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">she</label> never thought of questioning the hand recount . </p>
<p>`` Oh , gosh no. How many times do <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E13">you</label> need a recount ? </p>
<p>That 0027s crazy . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E10">Coburn</label> said ties were rare but not unheard of . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E10">She</label> has seen one other in <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E10">her</label> 20 years on the job . </p>
<p>The race for <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E58">township supervisor</label> was an engaging one from the beginning , since both <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Larson</label> already sit on <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E15">the township 0027s Board of Trustees</label> _ <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> as <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">supervisor</label> and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Larson</label> as <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">township clerk</label> . </p>
<p>`` It was interesting to watch the meetings , with <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">her</label> running against <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">him</label> and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E12">them both</label> having to sit together , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E18">Pat Gibson</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E18">owner of Gibson 0027s Hardware Store , who occasionally attends meetings</label> . </p>
<p>`` There was a little give and take . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">Fife Lake</label> came to life in 1872 and was <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">a thriving logging town</label> by 1885 . </p>
<p>Ice was harvested from <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E23">the frozen lake</label> in the winter for prerefrigeration ice boxes <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E24">downstate</label> . </p>
<p>Now it is mostly <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">a bedroom community for Traverse City to the north and Cadillac to the south</label> , though <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E26">some people</label> make a living farming Christmas trees or from summer tourism . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E27">The population</label> is between 1,800 and 1,900 , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">Township government</label> <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">here</label> mostly takes care of the <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E51">volunteer</label> <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E29">fire department</label> and <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E30">ambulance service</label> . </p>
<p>The annual budget of about $ 200,000 includes a $ 6,500 salary for <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E58">the part-time supervisor</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> said . </p>
<p>Although <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">he</label> admitted it was somewhat awkward to be challenged by <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E32">his own clerk</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> said the race was cordial and positive , with no striking campaign issues . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">I</label> think <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">I</label> 0027ve done a lot for <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E20">the township</label> , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> , 70 , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">a retired auto worker from Flint</label> . </p>

<p>And the kitty is a little better off than it was when <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">I</label> started . </p>
<p>00270027 `` <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E12">Both people</label> are well liked , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E35">Gary Gilmore</label> , 52 , as <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E35">he</label> sipped <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E35">his</label> Saturday morning coffee at <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E36">the Sugar Bowl Restaurant</label> . </p>

<p>00270027 Although the matter is being settled quietly , there was drama on election night . </p>
<p>The first count had <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Larson</label> , <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">a 66-year-old retired school clerk</label> , ahead by two votes . </p>

<p>A second run through the counting machine left <label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E16">Stremlow</label> the winner by one vote . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001210.1847.0092-E2">Larson</label> requested a hand-recount , which was held Dec. 1. It was there that one rejected ballot was discovered . </p>
