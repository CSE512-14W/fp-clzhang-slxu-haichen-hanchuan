<p>The status of <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2"><b>[43]</b>women</label> varies among <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E14"><b>[44]</b>countries in the Arab world</label> . </p>
<p>Although <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E16"><b>[47]</b>women in some parts of the Persian Gulf , such as conservative Saudi Arabia</label> , are required to be covered from head-to-toe and are not allowed to drive , <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E20"><b>[52]</b>their counterparts</label> in <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E21"><b>[53]</b>more liberal countries , including Jordan , Egypt and Lebanon</label> , enjoy more freedom and richer public lives . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E30"><b>[69]</b>Others</label> talked of the challenge of presenting a more positive , well-rounded image of <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2"><b>[71]</b>Arab women</label> in the face of negative stereotypes . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E31"><b>[72]</b>Some attendees</label> , however , were skeptical the gathering would reach any strong proposals . </p>
