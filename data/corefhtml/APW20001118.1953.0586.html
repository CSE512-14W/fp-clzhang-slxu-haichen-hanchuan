<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E6">Mubarak</label> , <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E6">wife of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak</label> and <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E6">one of the conference organizers</label> , said <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E55">they</label> must find ways to respect the social differences that distinguish <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E14">Arab countries</label> while still cooperating to attain the summit 0027s main goal : creating a better life for <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2">Arab women</label> . </p>
<p>The status of <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2">women</label> varies among <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E14">countries in the Arab world</label> . </p>
<p>Although <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E16">women in some parts of the Persian Gulf , such as conservative Saudi Arabia</label> , are required to be covered from head-to-toe and are not allowed to drive , <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E20">their counterparts</label> in <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E21">more liberal countries , including Jordan , Egypt and Lebanon</label> , enjoy more freedom and richer public lives . </p>
<p>However , illiteracy , marginalized decision-making roles and under-representation in politics are problems <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2">Arab women</label> share . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E25">Many women</label> , though , are struggling to change the status quo and have achieved some gains . </p>
<p>This year in <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E53">Egypt</label> , for example , avid campaigning helped <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E26">women</label> reverse laws that prevented <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E26">them</label> from obtaining divorce and traveling <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E51">abroad</label> without <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E27">their husbands</label> 0027 permission . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E28">Many of the speakers</label> underlined the importance of meeting the demands of the modern society while still preserving <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E57">Arab</label> identity , traditions and beliefs . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E30">Others</label> talked of the challenge of presenting a more positive , well-rounded image of <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E2">Arab women</label> in the face of negative stereotypes . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E31">Some attendees</label> , however , were skeptical the gathering would reach any strong proposals . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E32">Haifa Ezzi</label> , <label class="APW20001118.1953.0586-E32">a Saudi researcher interested in women 0027s issues</label> , said some of the speeches `` were full of unrealistic rhetoric . </p>
