<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E27"><b>[0]</b>A majority of women , older voters , Democrats , liberals and black , Hispanic and Asian voters</label> cast <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E27"><b>[1]</b>their</label> ballots for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[2]</b>Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[3]</b>George W. Bush</label> captured the votes of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E94"><b>[4]</b>most men , whites , conservatives , Republicans , Southerners and white Protestants</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E95"><b>[5]</b>Ralph Nader , who received 2 percent of the vote</label> , did best among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E96"><b>[6]</b>independents , particularly liberal ones</label> , and among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E2"><b>[7]</b>young men</label> . </p>
<p>But the national election was so close because <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E3"><b>[8]</b>several large groups</label> _ <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E4"><b>[9]</b>voters under 65</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E5"><b>[10]</b>independents</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E6"><b>[11]</b>voters from the Midwest and the West</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E9"><b>[12]</b>suburbanites</label> _ divided <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E3"><b>[13]</b>their</label> votes almost evenly between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E11"><b>[14]</b>the two major candidates</label> . </p>
<p>The accompanying table , drawn from surveys of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E12"><b>[15]</b>voters leaving the polls ( including those in Florida )</label> , shows how <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E16"><b>[16]</b>different groups</label> have voted for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E17"><b>[17]</b>president</label> since 1976 . </p>
<p>Because <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E18"><b>[18]</b>large numbers of people</label> are surveyed , exit polls can help measure the preferences of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E19"><b>[19]</b>groups like Jewish or Asian voters or young blacks or liberal Republicans whose portion of the voting population is often too small to examine in typical telephone surveys</label> . </p>
<p>The Gender Gap <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[20]</b>Bush</label> received a majority of votes from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E25"><b>[21]</b>men</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[22]</b>Gore</label> was backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E26"><b>[23]</b>a majority of women</label> . </p>
<p>That 's been a trend for at least 20 years : <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E29"><b>[24]</b>more women</label> vote for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E30"><b>[25]</b>Democrats</label> ; <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E28"><b>[26]</b>more men</label> prefer <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E38"><b>[27]</b>Republicans</label> . </p>
<p>This year , the gap was especially large . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[28]</b>Gore</label> got more votes from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E66"><b>[29]</b>women</label> than from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E25"><b>[30]</b>men</label> : 12 percentage points more . </p>
<p>The gender gap cut across all age groups and education levels , even among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E31"><b>[31]</b>black voters , who strongly supported Gore overall</label> . </p>
<p>The gender gap was widest among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E32"><b>[32]</b>college graduates</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E33"><b>[33]</b>unmarried voters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E35"><b>[34]</b>Party</label> Identification <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E36"><b>[35]</b>Few voters</label> crossed <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E35"><b>[36]</b>party</label> lines . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E37"><b>[37]</b>Large majorities of Republicans</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[38]</b>Bush</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[39]</b>Gore</label> won the votes of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E39"><b>[40]</b>most Democrats</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E5"><b>[41]</b>Voters who identified themselves as independent</label> split almost evenly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E40"><b>[42]</b>Most independents who described their political ideology as liberal</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[43]</b>Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[44]</b>Bush</label> was backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E41"><b>[45]</b>independents who characterized themselves as conservative</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E42"><b>[46]</b>Moderate independents</label> were very closely divided . </p>
<p>Where <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E43"><b>[47]</b>They</label> Live As in 1996 , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E44"><b>[48]</b>most Easterners</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[49]</b>the Democrat</label> . </p>
<p>But while four years ago , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E45"><b>[50]</b>Southerners</label> were evenly divided between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E46"><b>[51]</b>Bill Clinton</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E47"><b>[52]</b>Bob Dole</label> , this year <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[53]</b>Bush</label> carried the <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E48"><b>[54]</b>the South</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E7"><b>[55]</b>The Midwest</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E8"><b>[56]</b>the West</label> were almost evenly divided between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E11"><b>[57]</b>the two candidates</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[58]</b>Gore</label> did best among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E49"><b>[59]</b>urbanites</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[60]</b>Bush</label> ran stronger in <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E50"><b>[61]</b>smaller towns</label> and in <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E51"><b>[62]</b>rural areas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E9"><b>[63]</b>Suburban voters</label> split about evenly . </p>
<p>Pocketbook Concerns <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E52"><b>[64]</b>Voters who say their finances have improved during a president 's tenure</label> usually favor <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E53"><b>[65]</b>the incumbent</label> , while <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E54"><b>[66]</b>the challenger</label> is preferred by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E55"><b>[67]</b>those who say their financial situation has deteriorated</label> . </p>
<p>That held true this year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92"><b>[68]</b>Gore</label> was strongly backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E52"><b>[69]</b>voters who said their family 's finances were better than four years ago</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[70]</b>Bush</label> won the support of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E55"><b>[71]</b>those who said their financial situation had deteriorated</label> . </p>
<p>In 1996 , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E57"><b>[72]</b>one in three voters</label> said <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E57"><b>[73]</b>their</label> economic situation had improved over the previous four years . </p>
<p>This year , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E58"><b>[74]</b>half</label> did . </p>
<p>Generally , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E59"><b>[75]</b>those who say their economic conditions have not changed</label> divide <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E59"><b>[76]</b>their</label> support between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E60"><b>[77]</b>the two major candidates</label> pretty evenly . </p>
<p>This year , though , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E61"><b>[78]</b>two in three</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93"><b>[79]</b>Bush</label> . </p>
<p>Data for 2000 were collected by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E62"><b>[80]</b>Voter News Service</label> based on questionnaires completed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E63"><b>[81]</b>13,279 voters leaving 300 polling places around the nation on Election Day</label> . </p>
