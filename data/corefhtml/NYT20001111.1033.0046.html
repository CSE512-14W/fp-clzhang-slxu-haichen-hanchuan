<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E27">A majority of women , older voters , Democrats , liberals and black , Hispanic and Asian voters</label> cast <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E27">their</label> ballots for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">George W. Bush</label> captured the votes of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E94">most men , whites , conservatives , Republicans , Southerners and white Protestants</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E95">Ralph Nader , who received 2 percent of the vote</label> , did best among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E96">independents , particularly liberal ones</label> , and among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E2">young men</label> . </p>
<p>But the national election was so close because <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E3">several large groups</label> _ <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E4">voters under 65</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E5">independents</label> , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E6">voters from the Midwest and the West</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E9">suburbanites</label> _ divided <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E3">their</label> votes almost evenly between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E11">the two major candidates</label> . </p>
<p>The accompanying table , drawn from surveys of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E12">voters leaving the polls ( including those in Florida )</label> , shows how <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E16">different groups</label> have voted for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E17">president</label> since 1976 . </p>
<p>Because <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E18">large numbers of people</label> are surveyed , exit polls can help measure the preferences of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E19">groups like Jewish or Asian voters or young blacks or liberal Republicans whose portion of the voting population is often too small to examine in typical telephone surveys</label> . </p>
<p>The Gender Gap <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> received a majority of votes from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E25">men</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> was backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E26">a majority of women</label> . </p>
<p>That 0027s been a trend for at least 20 years : <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E29">more women</label> vote for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E30">Democrats</label> ; <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E28">more men</label> prefer <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E38">Republicans</label> . </p>
<p>This year , the gap was especially large . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> got more votes from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E66">women</label> than from <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E25">men</label> : 12 percentage points more . </p>
<p>The gender gap cut across all age groups and education levels , even among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E31">black voters , who strongly supported Gore overall</label> . </p>
<p>The gender gap was widest among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E32">college graduates</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E33">unmarried voters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E35">Party</label> Identification <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E36">Few voters</label> crossed <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E35">party</label> lines . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E37">Large majorities of Republicans</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> won the votes of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E39">most Democrats</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E5">Voters who identified themselves as independent</label> split almost evenly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E40">Most independents who described their political ideology as liberal</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> was backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E41">independents who characterized themselves as conservative</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E42">Moderate independents</label> were very closely divided . </p>
<p>Where <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E43">They</label> Live As in 1996 , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E44">most Easterners</label> supported <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">the Democrat</label> . </p>
<p>But while four years ago , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E45">Southerners</label> were evenly divided between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E46">Bill Clinton</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E47">Bob Dole</label> , this year <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> carried the <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E48">the South</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E7">The Midwest</label> and <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E8">the West</label> were almost evenly divided between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E11">the two candidates</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> did best among <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E49">urbanites</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> ran stronger in <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E50">smaller towns</label> and in <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E51">rural areas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E9">Suburban voters</label> split about evenly . </p>
<p>Pocketbook Concerns <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E52">Voters who say their finances have improved during a president 0027s tenure</label> usually favor <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E53">the incumbent</label> , while <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E54">the challenger</label> is preferred by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E55">those who say their financial situation has deteriorated</label> . </p>
<p>That held true this year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E92">Gore</label> was strongly backed by <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E52">voters who said their family 0027s finances were better than four years ago</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> won the support of <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E55">those who said their financial situation had deteriorated</label> . </p>
<p>In 1996 , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E57">one in three voters</label> said <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E57">their</label> economic situation had improved over the previous four years . </p>
<p>This year , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E58">half</label> did . </p>
<p>Generally , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E59">those who say their economic conditions have not changed</label> divide <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E59">their</label> support between <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E60">the two major candidates</label> pretty evenly . </p>
<p>This year , though , <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E61">two in three</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001111.1033.0046-E93">Bush</label> . </p>
