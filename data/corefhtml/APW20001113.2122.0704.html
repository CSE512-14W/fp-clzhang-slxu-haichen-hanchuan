<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E23"><b>[0]</b>WASHINGTON</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E38"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ Doubts remain in five races for <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E39"><b>[2]</b>the House of Representatives</label> , and while recounts are likely to extend the indecision they have no chance of erasing the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13"><b>[3]</b>Republican</label> majority for <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E41"><b>[4]</b>the incoming 107th Congress</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E38"><b>[5]</b>The Associated Press</label> has called <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E42"><b>[6]</b>winners in all but two House races : New Jersey 's 12th district battle between incumbent Democratic Rep. Rush Holt and GOP challenger Dick Zimmer , who formerly held the seat ; and in Florida 's 22nd District , where veteran GOP Rep. Clay Shaw has claimed a 586-vote victory following a recount over Democrat Elaine Bloom</label> . </p>
<p>But there remained some doubt about narrow decisions in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6"><b>[25]</b>Minnesota</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E7"><b>[26]</b>California</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E8"><b>[27]</b>Michigan</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E9"><b>[28]</b>where</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E10"><b>[29]</b>the apparent losers</label> refusing to concede and recounts have either begun or are likely . </p>
<p>In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E19"><b>[31]</b>Michigan 's 8th District</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20"><b>[33]</b>Republican Mike Rogers</label> was leading <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E21"><b>[35]</b>Democrat Dianne Byrum</label> by just 152 votes during a recanvass that must be completed by Nov. 21. <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20"><b>[36]</b>Rogers</label> has claimed the seat and was taking part in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E22"><b>[37]</b>freshman</label> orientation events at <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E24"><b>[38]</b>the Capitol</label> on Monday . </p>
<p>`` In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20"><b>[39]</b>my</label> mind , the campaign is over , '' <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20"><b>[40]</b>Rogers</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20"><b>[41]</b>I</label> 'm here trying to prepare for the next couple of years . </p>
<p>'' In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6"><b>[42]</b>Minnesota</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E25"><b>[44]</b>Republican Mark Kennedy</label> won a 150-vote decision over <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26"><b>[47]</b>four-term Democratic Rep. David Minge</label> for the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E28"><b>[48]</b>2nd District</label> seat . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26"><b>[49]</b>Minge</label> has said <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26"><b>[50]</b>he</label> will file a lawsuit to request a recount , but under <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6"><b>[51]</b>state</label> law <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26"><b>[52]</b>he</label> must wait until the results are certified Nov. 21. <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E30"><b>[54]</b>Rep.

<p>, had a more comfortable margin of 1,616 votes in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E30"><b>[57]</b>his</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E32"><b>[58]</b>38th District</label> victory over <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E33"><b>[60]</b>Democrat Gerrie Schipske</label> , but <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E33"><b>[61]</b>she</label> has refused to concede and awaits the results of absentee ballots and provisional ballots cast by <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E34"><b>[62]</b>people whose names did n't immediately match lists at polling stations</label> . </p>
<p>About 2,500 of these same provisional ballots also apparently hold the key to the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E11"><b>[65]</b>New Jersey</label> race between <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E46"><b>[66]</b>Holt</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E49"><b>[67]</b>Zimmer</label> , but further <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E36"><b>[68]</b>court</label> action could delay a final result for some time . </p>
<p>And in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E1"><b>[69]</b>Florida</label> , the same <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E37"><b>[70]</b>Palm Beach County</label> disputes involved in the presidential recount could lead to legal action by <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E5"><b>[71]</b>Bloom</label> . </p>
<p>Not counting the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E1"><b>[72]</b>Florida</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E11"><b>[73]</b>New Jersey</label> races , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13"><b>[74]</b>Republicans</label> now hold 220 seats in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E18"><b>[75]</b>the incoming House</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E14"><b>[76]</b>the Democrats</label> have 211 . </p>
<p>There are <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E15"><b>[77]</b>two independents</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E16"><b>[78]</b>one aligned with each party</label> , effectively giving <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13"><b>[80]</b>the GOP</label> an edge of 221-212 . </p>
