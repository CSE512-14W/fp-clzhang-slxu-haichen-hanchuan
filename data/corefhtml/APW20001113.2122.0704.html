<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E23">WASHINGTON</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E38">(AP)</label> _ Doubts remain in five races for <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E39">the House of Representatives</label> , and while recounts are likely to extend the indecision they have no chance of erasing the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13">Republican</label> majority for <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E41">the incoming 107th Congress</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E38">The Associated Press</label> has called <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E42">winners in all but two House races : New Jersey 0027s 12th district battle between incumbent Democratic Rep. Rush Holt and GOP challenger Dick Zimmer , who formerly held the seat ; and in Florida 0027s 22nd District , where veteran GOP Rep. Clay Shaw has claimed a 586-vote victory following a recount over Democrat Elaine Bloom</label> . </p>
<p>But there remained some doubt about narrow decisions in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6">Minnesota</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E7">California</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E8">Michigan</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E9">where</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E10">the apparent losers</label> refusing to concede and recounts have either begun or are likely . </p>
<p>In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E19">Michigan 0027s 8th District</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20">Republican Mike Rogers</label> was leading <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E21">Democrat Dianne Byrum</label> by just 152 votes during a recanvass that must be completed by Nov. 21. <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20">Rogers</label> has claimed the seat and was taking part in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E22">freshman</label> orientation events at <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E24">the Capitol</label> on Monday . </p>
<p>`` In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20">my</label> mind , the campaign is over , 00270027 <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20">Rogers</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E20">I</label> 0027m here trying to prepare for the next couple of years . </p>
<p>00270027 In <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6">Minnesota</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E25">Republican Mark Kennedy</label> won a 150-vote decision over <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26">four-term Democratic Rep. David Minge</label> for the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E28">2nd District</label> seat . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26">Minge</label> has said <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26">he</label> will file a lawsuit to request a recount , but under <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E6">state</label> law <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E26">he</label> must wait until the results are certified Nov. 21. <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E30">Rep. Steve Horn , R-Calif</label> . </p>
<p>, had a more comfortable margin of 1,616 votes in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E30">his</label> <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E32">38th District</label> victory over <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E33">Democrat Gerrie Schipske</label> , but <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E33">she</label> has refused to concede and awaits the results of absentee ballots and provisional ballots cast by <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E34">people whose names did n0027t immediately match lists at polling stations</label> . </p>
<p>About 2,500 of these same provisional ballots also apparently hold the key to the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E11">New Jersey</label> race between <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E46">Holt</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E49">Zimmer</label> , but further <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E36">court</label> action could delay a final result for some time . </p>
<p>And in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E1">Florida</label> , the same <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E37">Palm Beach County</label> disputes involved in the presidential recount could lead to legal action by <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E5">Bloom</label> . </p>
<p>Not counting the <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E1">Florida</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E11">New Jersey</label> races , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13">Republicans</label> now hold 220 seats in <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E18">the incoming House</label> and <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E14">the Democrats</label> have 211 . </p>
<p>There are <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E15">two independents</label> , <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E16">one aligned with each party</label> , effectively giving <label class="APW20001113.2122.0704-E13">the GOP</label> an edge of 221-212 . </p>
