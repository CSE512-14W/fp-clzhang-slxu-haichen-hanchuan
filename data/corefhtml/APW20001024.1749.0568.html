<p>Although 14 <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1"><b>[9]</b>Senate</label> seats are up for election this year , this is the only race without <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E2"><b>[10]</b>an incumbent</label> . </p>

<p>In 1997 , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32"><b>[48]</b>Nixon</label> was sentenced to six months in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E34"><b>[49]</b>jail</label> for propositioning <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E35"><b>[50]</b>a policewoman posing as a prostitute</label> . </p>

<p>The high-stakes race to replace <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32"><b>[54]</b>Nixon</label> has become one of the most expensive legislative contests ever . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60"><b>[77]</b>Staples , who is also 37</label> , said <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60"><b>[78]</b>he</label> supports vouchers if approved by local votes . </p>
<p>The votes of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E49"><b>[79]</b>about 9,000 residents of a recreational vehicle park</label> could be pivotal . </p>
