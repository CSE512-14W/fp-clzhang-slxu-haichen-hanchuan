<p>One Race May Determine Texas Senate </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E21">PALESTINE , Texas</label> <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E55">(AP)</label> _ With <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">the Republicans</label> clinging to a one-vote majority in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">the state Senate</label> , control of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">the chamber</label> could hinge on a single race in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E59">East Texas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">Republican Todd Staples</label> , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">a three-term state representative</label> , faces <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E63">Democratic lawyer David Fisher</label> in the Nov. 7 election . </p>
<p>Although 14 <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">Senate</label> seats are up for election this year , this is the only race without <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E2">an incumbent</label> . </p>
<p>The question of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E3">which party</label> controls <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">the Texas Senate</label> is especially important this year because <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">the Senate</label> will redraw <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E4">congressional and legislative districts</label> and could elect <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E5">the next lieutenant governor</label> if <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E6">Gov. George W. Bush</label> is elected <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E8">president</label> and is succeeded by <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E9">Lt. Gov. Rick Perry</label> . </p>
<p>`` From a small election in one <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">state Senate</label> race comes a lot , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E11">Bob Stein</label> , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E11">professor of political science at Rice University in Houston</label> . </p>
<p>`` It will determine the fate of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E15">the Democratic Party</label> and , largely , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">the Republican Party</label> in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E54">the state of Texas</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">The GOP</label> captured control of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">the Senate</label> in 1996 , giving <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">Republicans</label> <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">their</label> first majority in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E18">either legislative chamber</label> in 120 years . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E16">They</label> now hold the slimmest majority possible _ 16-15 . </p>
<p>Around <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E54">the state</label> , only <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E19">one incumbent</label> , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E19">a Democrat</label> , is considered vulnerable . </p>
<p>While <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E15">Democrats</label> have controlled <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E20">the Texas House</label> since the 1870s , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E15">their</label> majority has been diminishing since the 1980s . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E15">They</label> now hold a 78-72 advantage . </p>
<p>Only five of eight seats without <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E22">an incumbent</label> are contested . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E23">The heavily wooded Senate district</label> stretches from <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E24">Tyler</label> to north of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E14">Houston</label> , with logging , oil and gas exploration and outdoor recreation among <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E25">the main industries</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E23">The district</label> also is <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E23">home to Jasper , where a black man was dragged to his death from a pickup truck by three white men in 1998</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E1">Senate</label> seat in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E31">the traditionally Democratic region</label> is being vacated by <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">Republican Sen. Drew Nixon , who decided , with the encouragement of the GOP , not to seek another term</label> . </p>
<p>In 1997 , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">Nixon</label> was sentenced to six months in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E34">jail</label> for propositioning <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E35">a policewoman posing as a prostitute</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">He</label> did <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">his</label> time on weekends while continuing to serve as <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">a lawmaker</label> . </p>
<p>The high-stakes race to replace <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32">Nixon</label> has become one of the most expensive legislative contests ever . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E38">State Senate candidates</label> typically spend less than $ 35,000 , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E11">Stein</label> said . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">Staples</label> said <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">he</label> has raised nearly $ 1.9 million . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E40">Of 1,944 donors , 19</label> are from outside <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E54">Texas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E41">More than 835</label> are from outside <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E23">the district</label> . </p>
<p>And <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E63">Fisher</label> said <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E63">he</label> has raised about $ 1.4 million . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E43">Of 1,400 contributors to his campaign , fewer than 20</label> are from out of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E54">Texas</label> , and <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E43">they</label> contributed about 2 percent of the total amount raised , <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E63">he</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E17">About 40 percent of the contributors</label> live in <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E23">the district</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E44">Both candidates</label> support pay raises for <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E45">prison employees</label> and more affordable health insurance for <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E47">teachers</label> and vow to oppose any plan to transfer water out of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E59">East Texas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E63">Fisher , who is 37 and is making his first try for office</label> , opposes <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E48">school</label> vouchers . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">Staples , who is also 37</label> , said <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E60">he</label> supports vouchers if approved by local votes . </p>
<p>The votes of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E49">about 9,000 residents of a recreational vehicle park</label> could be pivotal . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E49">Their</label> eligibility to vote was challenged by <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E52">other residents of the district</label> because many of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E49">them</label> spend most of the year traveling . </p>
