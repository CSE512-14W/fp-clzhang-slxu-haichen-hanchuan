<p>The high-stakes race to replace <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E32"><b>[81]</b>Nixon</label> has become one of the most expensive legislative contests ever . </p>

<p>The votes of <label class="APW20001024.1749.0568-E49"><b>[116]</b>about 9,000 residents of a recreational vehicle park</label> could be pivotal . </p>
