<p><label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E19"><b>[0]</b>CHICAGO</label> <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E21"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E18"><b>[2]</b>A federal judge</label> has issued a temporary restraining order against <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E10"><b>[3]</b>Copley Press Inc.</label> blocking the sale of <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E17"><b>[4]</b>The News Sun in Waukegan</label> to <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E4"><b>[6]</b>Hollinger International</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E18"><b>[7]</b>The judge</label> 's ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed last week by <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E27"><b>[8]</b>the union representing editorial workers at the paper</label> , <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E27"><b>[11]</b>which</label> claims the sale would not require <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E4"><b>[12]</b>Hollinger</label> to honor a collective-bargaining agreement reached between <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E17"><b>[13]</b>the paper</label> and <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E29"><b>[14]</b>employees</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E30"><b>[15]</b>Lawyers for the Chicago Newspaper Guild</label> say language in the agreement is `` not satisfactory . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E18"><b>[19]</b>U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning</label> on Tuesday barred the sale of <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E17"><b>[20]</b>the paper</label> for at least 10 days , giving <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E10"><b>[21]</b>Copley</label> time to reword the agreement . </p>
<p>`` If the sale were allowed to proceed , <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E27"><b>[22]</b>the union</label> would be without a legal remedy and would suffer the irreparable harm of having the ( agreement ) being rendered a nullity , '' <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E18"><b>[23]</b>Manning</label> wrote . </p>
<p>After the hearing , <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E1"><b>[24]</b>lawyers for Copley</label> would not say if <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E1"><b>[26]</b>they</label> would appeal <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E18"><b>[27]</b>Manning</label> 's restraining order . </p>
<p>Calls to <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E2"><b>[28]</b>Douglas A. Darch</label> , <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E2"><b>[29]</b>an attorney for Copley</label> , were not immediately returned on Wednesday . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E27"><b>[31]</b>The guild</label> has filed a grievance to have the matter arbitrated with <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E10"><b>[32]</b>Copley</label> before the sale is completed . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E4"><b>[33]</b>Hollinger International</label> , <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E4"><b>[34]</b>owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and the Daily Southtown in Tinley Park</label> , is attempting to acquire <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E17"><b>[38]</b>The News Sun</label> and <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E8"><b>[41]</b>other northern Illinois Copley newspapers , including The Courier News in Elgin , The Beacon News in Aurora and The Herald News in Joliet</label> . </p>
<p>Although the ruling did not mention <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E8"><b>[49]</b>the other Copley Press papers</label> , it is expected that <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E17"><b>[50]</b>The News Sun</label> issue will have be resolved before the sale of <label class="APW20001129.1802.0602-E8"><b>[51]</b>the entire group</label> is finalized . </p>
