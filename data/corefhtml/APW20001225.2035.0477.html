<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E19">WASHINGTON</label> <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E54">(AP)</label> _ All else being equal , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">Duane Roelands</label> would prefer to dash off short instant text messages to <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E56">co-workers</label> and <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E57">friends</label> with the service offered by <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E58">Microsoft</label> _ the one <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">he</label> finds easiest to use . </p>
<p>But for <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">Roelands</label> , all else is not equal : <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E59">His office</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E60">clients</label> and <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E61">nearly everyone else he knows</label> use <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">America Online</label> 0027s messaging system . </p>
<p>Now , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">he</label> does too . </p>
<p>`` There are features that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">I</label> want and <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">I</label> like , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">Roelands</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">a Web developer</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">who</label> likens it to the battle between VHS and Beta video recorders in the 1980s . </p>
<p>`` But the reality is if <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">I</label> use the better product , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E55">I</label> get less functionality . </p>
<p>00270027 For this reason , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E1">instant messaging rivals like Microsoft , AT0026AMP ; T and ExciteAtHome</label> maintain <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E4">their users</label> ought to be able to send messages to <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E5">anyone else</label> , regardless of what service <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E5">they</label> happen to have . </p>
<p>That 0027s not currently possible . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E1">The companies</label> are lobbying <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">the Federal Communications Commission</label> to require <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> to make <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">its</label> product compatible with those offered by <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E7">competitors</label> as a condition of <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">its</label> merger with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E8">Time Warner</label> . </p>
<p>So far , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">the agency</label> appears to favor a more tailored approach . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E9">The commission 0027s staff</label> has recommended that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> be required to make <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">its</label> system work with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E10">at least one other provider</label> , but the requirement would apply only to advanced instant messaging services offered over <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E11">Time Warner 0027s cable lines</label> . </p>
<p>How <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">the agency</label> defines advanced services is unclear . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">They</label> could refer to features beyond text messaging , such as video teleconferencing , the sharing of files or messaging over interactive television . </p>
<p>Today , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E12">consumers</label> more commonly take advantage of the garden variety functions . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E12">They</label> type short real-time phrases to <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E13">others</label> , allowing <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E12">them</label> to `` chat 00270027 back-and-forth using text . </p>
<p>Unlike e-mail , it 0027s instantaneous and gets <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E14">the recipient</label> 0027s attention right away . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E12">People</label> can communicate with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E15">international friends</label> without the hefty phone bills . </p>
<p>And the service has taken hold with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E16">those who have hearing or speech disabilities</label> . </p>
<p>Unlike the telephone , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E12">people</label> can discreetly interact with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E13">others</label> _ or decide not to . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s communications that can be ignored , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E18">Jonathan Sacks</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E18">a vice president at AOL , which runs the two leading messaging services _ ICQ and AIM _ with 140 million users</label> . </p>
<p>`` On the telephone , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E23">you</label> ca n0027t see when <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E24">somebody</label> is near the phone . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E23">You</label> ca n0027t see when it 0027s convenient for <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E24">them</label> to communicate with <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E23">you</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E1">AOL rivals</label> say that if instant messaging is to be as ubiquitous as the phone network , it has to work the same way : <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E25">People who use different providers</label> must still be able to contact one another . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E1">They</label> continue to lobby <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">the FCC</label> , hoping to see the conditions broadened before <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">the agency</label> issues <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E6">its</label> final decision . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s really important to get this right before innovation is squashed because <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E27">one company</label> has a monopoly , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E28">Jon Englund</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E28">vice president of government affairs for ExciteAtHome</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s absolutely critical that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E31">Internet uses</label> have real choice among competing platforms . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> has said <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">it</label> wants to work toward interoperability , but first needs to protect <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E32">consumer</label> privacy and security to prevent the kinds of problems that have emerged in the e-mail world , like spamming _ unwanted junk messages . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E33">Company officials</label> disagreed that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> 0027s market share was keeping out <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E35">competitors</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E37">AOL executives</label> cited a recent study by <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E38">Media Metrix</label> indicating that the messaging services offered by <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E39">Yahoo !</label> </p>
<p>and <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E58">Microsoft</label> are the fastest growing in <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E30">the United States</label> . </p>
<p>Why all the fuss over a free product that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E41">anyone , even those who do n0027t subscribe to AOL</label> , can use ? </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E43">Some</label> pointed to the recent demise of <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E44">two instant messaging competitors</label> _ <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E46">iCAST</label> and <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E47">Tribal Voice</label> _ as evidence that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> 0027s dominance could prevent choices in the market . </p>
<p>Another concern is that <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">AOL</label> could use <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E34">its</label> substantial <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E48">customer</label> base to tack on new advanced services and then charge for them . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E1">Rivals</label> said the ability of various services to work together will become increasingly important in the future . </p>
<p>For example , as instant messaging migrates to cell phones or hand-held computer organizers , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E17">consumers</label> wo n0027t want to have to install multiple services on these devices , said <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E21">Brian Park</label> , <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E21">senior product for Yahoo !</label> </p>
<p>Communications Services . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E51">You</label> can have the best service and the coolest features , but <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E52">nobody</label> is going to use it if it does n0027t communicate with other services , 00270027 <label class="APW20001225.2035.0477-E21">Park</label> said . </p>
