<p>INVESTORS FEEL EFFECTS OF MIDEAST VIOLENCE </p>
<p>( For release Sunday , Oct. 22 ) & QL ; & UR ; By JOSEPH B. TREASTER & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; </p>
<p>In just two weeks this month , as <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E21"><b>[0]</b>investors</label> worried whether the violence in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[1]</b>the Middle East</label> would escalate into war , the stock market in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[2]</b>Israel</label> fell 16 percent . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41"><b>[3]</b>Egypt</label> , the market dropped 20 percent . </p>
<p>But for <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E42"><b>[4]</b>most American investors , many of whom buy their stocks through mutual funds</label> , the impact was more diffuse , though still strong . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E45"><b>[5]</b>few investors</label> own funds containing <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E46"><b>[6]</b>many Middle Eastern companies</label> , partly because there are not that many around to buy , they nonetheless felt the effects of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[7]</b>the region</label> 's volatility . </p>
<p>Wall Street and other global markets were concerned that the violence would translate into higher oil prices _ which it did , briefly _ and that those prices , in turn , could lead to inflation and higher interest rates . </p>
<p>That line of thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Oct. 12 _ the day that <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E48"><b>[8]</b>a Palestinian mob</label> mauled <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E50"><b>[9]</b>two Israeli soldiers</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[10]</b>Israel</label> retaliated with <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E3"><b>[11]</b>rocket</label> attacks and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E4"><b>[12]</b>terrorists</label> blew a hole in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E5"><b>[13]</b>a United States warship in Yemen</label> . </p>
<p>Last week , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E8"><b>[14]</b>Israeli and Palestinian leaders</label> agreed to the terms of a cease-fire after clashes in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E10"><b>[15]</b>the West Bank</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E9"><b>[16]</b>the Gaza Strip</label> . </p>
<p>`` For <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E11"><b>[17]</b>American investors</label> , the oil effect was much more significant than the direct effect on <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12"><b>[18]</b>Middle East companies</label> , '' said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E13"><b>[19]</b>Grace Pineda , who manages the $ 132 million Developing Capital Markets fund for Merrill Lynch</label> . </p>
<p>The fund has about 5 percent of its money in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[20]</b>Israel</label> and about 0.5 percent in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41"><b>[21]</b>Egypt</label> . </p>
<p>From late September , when the latest trouble erupted in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[22]</b>the Middle East</label> , through last week , the broad markets and several categories of mutual funds lost ground in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6"><b>[23]</b>the United States</label> . </p>
<p>In the most violent period , Oct. 5 through 12 , equity income funds were down 4.80 percent , according to <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E15"><b>[24]</b>Lipper Inc.</label> Growth funds were off 7.79 percent , and growth-and-income funds 6.12 percent . </p>
<p>Those funds generally do not contain shares of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12"><b>[25]</b>Middle Eastern companies</label> , yet the trouble in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[26]</b>the region</label> was among several factors _ along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications stocks _ that brought down prices . </p>
<p>Emerging-markets funds declined 7.17 percent over that period . </p>
<p>Although many of those funds invest in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12"><b>[27]</b>Middle Eastern companies</label> , the ripple effect of the threat to oil affected <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12"><b>[28]</b>them</label> most , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E16"><b>[29]</b>analysts</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E17"><b>[30]</b>fund managers</label> said . </p>
<p>And those funds ' investments in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[31]</b>the region</label> are still relatively small , usually less than 10 percent of the portfolios . </p>
<p>`` Most of the markets in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[32]</b>the Middle East</label> are insignificant in terms of the amount of capital invested in them from <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6"><b>[33]</b>the United States</label> , '' said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18"><b>[34]</b>Mark Madden</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18"><b>[35]</b>manager of the $ 250 million Pioneer Emerging Markets fund</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18"><b>[36]</b>Madden</label> invests mainly in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E20"><b>[37]</b>Mexico</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E22"><b>[38]</b>Brazil</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E23"><b>[39]</b>Korea</label> . </p>
<p>About 5 percent of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18"><b>[40]</b>his</label> portfolio is in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[41]</b>Israel</label> and less than 1 percent is in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41"><b>[42]</b>Egypt</label> . </p>
<p>Except during such tense times in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[43]</b>the Middle East</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E16"><b>[44]</b>analysts</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E17"><b>[45]</b>fund managers</label> said , fluctuations in the <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6"><b>[46]</b>United States</label> markets , the biggest and most dynamic in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E24"><b>[47]</b>the world</label> , are more likely to influence share prices in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[48]</b>the Middle East</label> than vice versa . </p>
<p>`` The first thing <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E26"><b>[49]</b>overseas traders</label> want to know when <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E26"><b>[50]</b>they</label> come in in the morning is , ` What did the Nasdaq and the Dow do ? </p>
<p>'' ' said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E27"><b>[51]</b>Howard Klein</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E27"><b>[52]</b>an institutional broker specializing in emerging markets at SG Cowen Securities in New York</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E31"><b>[53]</b>Traders in Israel</label> in particular have <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E31"><b>[54]</b>their</label> eyes on the Nasdaq . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[55]</b>Their country</label> is also <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1"><b>[56]</b>home to global technology , telecommunications and pharmaceutical companies , which depend on economic currents in the United States and Europe much more than on developments in the Middle East</label> . </p>
<p>Shares of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E39"><b>[57]</b>many Israeli companies</label> are sold as American Depository Receipts on the Nasdaq . </p>
<p>Only a handful of small funds concentrate on <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40"><b>[58]</b>the Middle East</label> . </p>
<p>One of them , the $ 25 million American Israel Index mutual fund , is made up exclusively of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E34"><b>[59]</b>Israeli companies , 16 traded on the Tel Aviv exchange and 19 on the Nasdaq</label> . </p>
<p>Like more broadly based mutual funds , its shares fell during the recent turmoil . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E37"><b>[60]</b>its investors</label> remained confident . </p>
