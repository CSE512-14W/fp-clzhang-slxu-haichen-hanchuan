<p>In <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41">Egypt</label> , the market dropped 20 percent . </p>
<p>But for <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E42">most American investors , many of whom buy their stocks through mutual funds</label> , the impact was more diffuse , though still strong . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E45">few investors</label> own funds containing <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E46">many Middle Eastern companies</label> , partly because there are not that many around to buy , they nonetheless felt the effects of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the region</label> 0027s volatility . </p>
<p>Wall Street and other global markets were concerned that the violence would translate into higher oil prices _ which it did , briefly _ and that those prices , in turn , could lead to inflation and higher interest rates . </p>
<p>That line of thinking played a big role in the 379-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 93-point drop in the Nasdaq composite index on Oct. 12 _ the day that <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E48">a Palestinian mob</label> mauled <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E50">two Israeli soldiers</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1">Israel</label> retaliated with <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E3">rocket</label> attacks and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E4">terrorists</label> blew a hole in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E5">a United States warship in Yemen</label> . </p>
<p>Last week , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E8">Israeli and Palestinian leaders</label> agreed to the terms of a cease-fire after clashes in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E10">the West Bank</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E9">the Gaza Strip</label> . </p>
<p>`` For <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E11">American investors</label> , the oil effect was much more significant than the direct effect on <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12">Middle East companies</label> , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E13">Grace Pineda , who manages the $ 132 million Developing Capital Markets fund for Merrill Lynch</label> . </p>
<p>The fund has about 5 percent of its money in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1">Israel</label> and about 0.5 percent in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41">Egypt</label> . </p>
<p>From late September , when the latest trouble erupted in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the Middle East</label> , through last week , the broad markets and several categories of mutual funds lost ground in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6">the United States</label> . </p>
<p>In the most violent period , Oct. 5 through 12 , equity income funds were down 4.80 percent , according to <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E15">Lipper Inc.</label> Growth funds were off 7.79 percent , and growth-and-income funds 6.12 percent . </p>
<p>Those funds generally do not contain shares of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12">Middle Eastern companies</label> , yet the trouble in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the region</label> was among several factors _ along with a general sell-off in technology and telecommunications stocks _ that brought down prices . </p>
<p>Emerging-markets funds declined 7.17 percent over that period . </p>
<p>Although many of those funds invest in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12">Middle Eastern companies</label> , the ripple effect of the threat to oil affected <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E12">them</label> most , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E16">analysts</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E17">fund managers</label> said . </p>
<p>And those funds 0027 investments in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the region</label> are still relatively small , usually less than 10 percent of the portfolios . </p>
<p>`` Most of the markets in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the Middle East</label> are insignificant in terms of the amount of capital invested in them from <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6">the United States</label> , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18">Mark Madden</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18">manager of the $ 250 million Pioneer Emerging Markets fund</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18">Madden</label> invests mainly in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E20">Mexico</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E22">Brazil</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E23">Korea</label> . </p>
<p>About 5 percent of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E18">his</label> portfolio is in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1">Israel</label> and less than 1 percent is in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E41">Egypt</label> . </p>
<p>Except during such tense times in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the Middle East</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E16">analysts</label> and <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E17">fund managers</label> said , fluctuations in the <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E6">United States</label> markets , the biggest and most dynamic in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E24">the world</label> , are more likely to influence share prices in <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the Middle East</label> than vice versa . </p>
<p>`` The first thing <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E26">overseas traders</label> want to know when <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E26">they</label> come in in the morning is , ` What did the Nasdaq and the Dow do ? </p>
<p>00270027 0027 said <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E27">Howard Klein</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E27">an institutional broker specializing in emerging markets at SG Cowen Securities in New York</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E31">Traders in Israel</label> in particular have <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E31">their</label> eyes on the Nasdaq . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1">Their country</label> is also <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E1">home to global technology , telecommunications and pharmaceutical companies , which depend on economic currents in the United States and Europe much more than on developments in the Middle East</label> . </p>
<p>Shares of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E39">many Israeli companies</label> are sold as American Depository Receipts on the Nasdaq . </p>
<p>Only a handful of small funds concentrate on <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E40">the Middle East</label> . </p>
<p>One of them , the $ 25 million American Israel Index mutual fund , is made up exclusively of <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E34">Israeli companies , 16 traded on the Tel Aviv exchange and 19 on the Nasdaq</label> . </p>
<p>Like more broadly based mutual funds , its shares fell during the recent turmoil . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001020.2025.0304-E37">its investors</label> remained confident . </p>
