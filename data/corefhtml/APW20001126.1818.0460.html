<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E23"><b>[0]</b>SEOUL , South Korea</label> <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E30"><b>[2]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E31"><b>[5]</b>Two major South Korean labor groups</label> rallied <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[6]</b>about 15,000 workers in central Seoul</label> on Sunday to protest <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[8]</b>government-led</label> <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E36"><b>[9]</b>corporate</label> restructuring <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E31"><b>[10]</b>they</label> fear will lead to mass layoffs . </p>
<p>It was the first such joint rally in three years for <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E37"><b>[11]</b>the Federation of Korean Trade Unions</label> and <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E38"><b>[12]</b>the militant Korean Confederation of Trade Unions</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E31"><b>[13]</b>The two</label> have <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E39"><b>[14]</b>a combined membership of 1.8 million</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[16]</b>The protesters , many carrying signs or wearing red headbands and vests with slogans such as `` Fight '' and `` Solidarity '' printed on them</label> , chanted and pumped <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[18]</b>their</label> fists in the air . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E1"><b>[19]</b>we</label> will be driven out to <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E2"><b>[20]</b>the streets</label> just for working hard , let <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E1"><b>[21]</b>'s</label> not work . </p>
<p>Let <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E1"><b>[22]</b>'s</label> strike ! </p>
<p>'' said <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E3"><b>[23]</b>Kim Yon-hwan</label> , <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E3"><b>[24]</b>head of an umbrella group for state utility labor unions</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[29]</b>The workers</label> marched from <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E9"><b>[30]</b>Seoul train station</label> to <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E10"><b>[31]</b>a cathedral a few miles away</label> , clogging up traffic . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[32]</b>They</label> dispersed peacefully after the 2 1/2-hour-long rally . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E11"><b>[33]</b>Thousands of uniformed police officers , some with shields</label> , stood around <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E33"><b>[35]</b>the protesters</label> to guard against possible violence , but there was no report of clashes . </p>
<p>The protest was partly in support of <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E13"><b>[36]</b>workers at Korea Electric Power Corp. , a state-run power company which the government plans to break into several units and sell</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E17"><b>[43]</b>A 950-megawatt electric power plant belonging to the firm</label> has already been sold to <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E18"><b>[45]</b>a consortium of local and foreign firms</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E19"><b>[47]</b>Experts</label> say <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[48]</b>the nation</label> 's economy might face recession if <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[49]</b>the government</label> does not speed up restructuring <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E20"><b>[50]</b>heavily indebted businesses and banks</label> . </p>
<p>In a drastic measure earlier this month , <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E21"><b>[52]</b>government-controlled creditor banks</label> named <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E22"><b>[53]</b>52 financially weak companies that should be shut down or merged for sale</label> . </p>
<p>The move shocked <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E24"><b>[55]</b>tens of thousands of workers who work for those and other financially shaky companies , which have been surviving on emergency bank loans</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[61]</b>South Korea</label> was forced to accept a $ 58 billion bailout fund from <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E27"><b>[62]</b>the International Monetary Fund</label> in late 1997 to save <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[63]</b>its</label> economy . </p>
<p>In return , <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E8"><b>[64]</b>it</label> promised to restructure <label class="APW20001126.1818.0460-E28"><b>[66]</b>its bloated businesses and inefficient financial sector</label> . </p>
