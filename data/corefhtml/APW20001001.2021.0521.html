<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">Assad</label> , on <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">his</label> first trip <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E22">abroad</label> since becoming <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">president</label> in July , also dealt with the issue of <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E1">Iraq</label> in the talks with <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E49">Mubarak</label> , <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E2">Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Mussa</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">The Syrian leader</label> 0027s visit came on a fourth day of clashes that have raged in <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E5">the West Bank</label> , <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E6">Gaza Strip</label> and <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E7">Jerusalem</label> , leaving <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E8">more than two dozen Palestinians</label> dead . </p>
<p>`` There is complete agreement ( between <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E49">Mubarak</label> and <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">Assad</label> ) as to the seriousness of the situation and that the negative repercussions would adversely effect the peace process , which is in itself in a very precarious state , 00270027 <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E2">Moussa</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">Assad , 35</label> , has focused on domestic issues since <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">his father</label> , <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">Hafez Assad</label> , died in June after 30 years in power . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">He</label> has taken steps to modernize <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E11">his nation 0027s bureaucracy</label> and revive <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E4">its</label> stagnant economy . </p>
<p>`` This was the first meeting of the first visit of <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">President Bashar Assad</label> after the funeral of <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">his father</label> , so it was only normal for the discussions to have a general tone ... in addition to certain specifics of special importance to <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E12">both countries</label> and <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E13">the Arab world</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E2">Moussa</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">The late Syrian president</label> rarely traveled <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E22">abroad</label> . </p>
<p>In <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">his</label> last few years , however , <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">he</label> had sent <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">Bashar , educated as an eye doctor</label> , on foreign trips as part of <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">his</label> grooming to become <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">president</label> . </p>
<p>Prospects appear dim for progress on either the <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E4">Syrian</label> or <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E54">Palestinian</label> peace track . </p>
<p>The deadlock in <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E54">Palestinian-Israeli</label> talks is exacerbated by the worst violence in four years . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E17">Syria 0027s government-run media</label> said last week that no progress could be expected now because of the <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E19">U.S.</label> elections and <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E20">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak</label> 0027s precarious situation as <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E20">leader of a minority government</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E16">Syrian-Israeli</label> peace negotiations broke down in January , with <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E4">Syria</label> demanding a full withdrawal from <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E25">the Golan Heights</label> , <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E25">a strategic plateau captured by Israel in 1967</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E16">Israel</label> insists on waiting to settle <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E28">borders</label> until <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E16">it</label> knows what <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E16">it</label> will gain by returning <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E30">Golan land</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">Assad</label> has made it clear <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E14">he</label> intends to follow <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E9">his father</label> 0027s course in any negotiations with <label class="APW20001001.2021.0521-E16">Israel</label> . </p>
