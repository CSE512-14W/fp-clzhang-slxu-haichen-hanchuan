<p>PUDDING , SWEET AND NOT </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E1"><b>[0]</b>NEW YORK</label> _ Bread pudding is one of the most traditional <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E2"><b>[1]</b>American</label> dishes ; cookbooks from the 18th century have recipes for it that are more or less the same as what <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E3"><b>[2]</b>we</label> make today . </p>
<p>But bread pudding is also a minimalist sort of dish , no more than dry bread mixed together with milk and eggs and whatever flavor strikes <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E4"><b>[3]</b>the cook</label> , and then baked until it is rich and custardy . </p>
<p>It can be savory or sweet , and either makes a simple , interesting substitute for a standard part of the Thanksgiving meal . </p>
<p>Savory bread pudding is a luxurious side dish that can be served in place of stuffing . </p>
<p>Or it can be the extra stuffing that <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E5"><b>[4]</b>everyone</label> always wants ( but not dry like the usual kind baked outside a turkey can be ) . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E6"><b>[5]</b>My</label> basic recipe combines the cubed bread , eggs and milk with a couple of cheeses . </p>
<p>( If <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[6]</b>you</label> 're desperate for oven space , bake it and then heat it just before serving , or serve it at room temperature . </p>
<p>) <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[7]</b>You</label> can make it without the mushrooms , too . </p>
<p>The pudding can also be varied by adding a pinch of thyme or sage , chopped nuts or cooked chestnuts , or about a cup of grated sweet potato or chopped scallions . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[8]</b>you</label> want a pudding that tastes more like stuffing , just add chopped celery , onions , carrots and herbs . </p>
<p>Sweet bread pudding is made the same way , but with fewer ingredients . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E6"><b>[9]</b>I</label> use maple syrup instead of sugar for the extra flavor and moisture . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[10]</b>You</label> can add more spices , including a small grating of nutmeg , chopped crystallized ginger , raisins or prunes soaked in Armagnac . </p>
<p>The kind of bread <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[11]</b>you</label> choose makes a difference . </p>
<p>Fluffy packaged white bread disappears ; the crusts of crisp baguettes and peasant breads never become tender . </p>
<p>For savory pudding , stick to long , wide inexpensive loaves , usually called Italian bread ; for sweet pudding , stale hallah is best . </p>
<p>And make sure the bread is thoroughly and evenly soaked before it 's baked ; <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E6"><b>[12]</b>I</label> like to submerge the bread with a weighted plate before baking . </p>
<p>Then <label class="NYT20001114.0210.0200-E7"><b>[13]</b>you</label> do n't even have to stir . </p>
