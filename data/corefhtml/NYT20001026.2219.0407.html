<p>` THE SCULPTRESS 0027 : THE REAL MYSTERY IS WHY ? </p>

<p>Back in the pre-cable heyday of UHF <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E16">you</label> could occasionally find , in the wee hours of the morning , a bafflingly obscure , strangely arty kind of horror film , which starred <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E17">nobody you recognized</label> and which made , even through the haze of insomnia , very little sense . </p>
<p>This murky genre survives mostly on the <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E18">USA</label> cable network and in the straight-to-video market , but with `` The Sculptress 00270027 it surfaces _ briefly , one assumes _ in theatrical release . </p>
<p>The movie 0027s relative restraint when it comes to gore , nudity and bad language makes late-night broadcast television its ideal venue , as does its air of solemn boredom . </p>
