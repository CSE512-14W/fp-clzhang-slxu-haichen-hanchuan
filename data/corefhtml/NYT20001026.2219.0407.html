<p>` THE SCULPTRESS ' : THE REAL MYSTERY IS WHY ? </p>

<p>Back in the pre-cable heyday of UHF <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E16"><b>[0]</b>you</label> could occasionally find , in the wee hours of the morning , a bafflingly obscure , strangely arty kind of horror film , which starred <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E17"><b>[1]</b>nobody you recognized</label> and which made , even through the haze of insomnia , very little sense . </p>
<p>This murky genre survives mostly on the <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E18"><b>[2]</b>USA</label> cable network and in the straight-to-video market , but with `` The Sculptress '' it surfaces _ briefly , one assumes _ in theatrical release . </p>
<p>The movie 's relative restraint when it comes to gore , nudity and bad language makes late-night broadcast television its ideal venue , as does its air of solemn boredom . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[3]</b>Katie Wright</label> plays <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[4]</b>Sarah</label> , <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[5]</b>a British art student studying in San Francisco , where she happens to live next door to a serial killer ( Jeff Fahey ) who dons outlandish costumes to stalk his victims</label> . </p>
<p>To make matters worse _ not so much for <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[6]</b>Sarah</label> as for <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E1"><b>[7]</b>the audience</label> _ <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[8]</b>this troubled fellow</label> is not <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[9]</b>just your run-of-the-mill sexually frustrated , split-personality slasher</label> but <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[10]</b>some kind of evil spirit who has , perhaps unwittingly , infiltrated his neighbor 's mind</label> . </p>
<p>It takes <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E5"><b>[11]</b>a panicky fortune teller</label> and <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E6"><b>[12]</b>a kindly ( if vaguely lecherous ) sculpture professor</label> to figure this out _ <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E6"><b>[13]</b>the professor</label> draws a helpful diagram featuring words like `` incubus '' and `` demon child '' _ but <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E7"><b>[14]</b>they</label> ca n't do much to help <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[15]</b>poor Sarah , who must also fend off the advances of an aggressive classmate , struggle with the demands of her art and , in her modest contribution to the film 's doomy atmosphere , light candles in a dim , spooky church</label> . </p>
<p>Meanwhile , <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[16]</b>her neighbor</label> , when <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[17]</b>he</label> 's not reciting `` Hamlet '' in <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[18]</b>his</label> apartment , dresses up as <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E10"><b>[19]</b>some kind of 19th-century German baron , complete with fake beard , walking stick and kid gloves _ the kind of get-up women in San Francisco apparently find irresistible</label> . </p>
<p>`` The Sculptress '' is so poorly written , badly acted and ineptly directed that it denies <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E13"><b>[20]</b>you</label> even the modest pleasure of making fun of it . </p>
<p>Since <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E13"><b>[21]</b>you</label> know the identity of <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E2"><b>[22]</b>the killer</label> well in advance , and since <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[23]</b>Wright</label> 's dull pouting and slack line-reading make it impossible to care what happens to <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E19"><b>[24]</b>her character</label> , the only real mystery is why this film was ever made . </p>
<p>`` The Sculptress '' is rated R ( Under 17 requires accompanying <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E14"><b>[25]</b>parent</label> or <label class="NYT20001026.2219.0407-E15"><b>[26]</b>adult guardian</label> ) . </p>
