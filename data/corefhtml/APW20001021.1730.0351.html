<p>`` This event shall serve as a beacon for the uprising of <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E60">concerned people</label> , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E61">North Rhine-Westphalia governor Wolfgang Clement</label> , alluding to <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E64">Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder</label> 0027s call for <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E49">ordinary Germans</label> to speak out against a recent wave of hate . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E66">Organizers</label> said <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E67">20,000 people</label> attended the event in <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E1">Dortmund</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E1">an industrial center in North Rhine-Westphalia , Germany 0027s most populous state</label> . </p>
<p>Later , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E4">about 600 neo-Nazis</label> marched through <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E5">the middle of town</label> under heavy <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E6">police</label> guard . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E7">Three officers</label> were injured as <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E8">leftist counter-demonstrators</label> tried to break through <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E9">police</label> lines , and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E10">two leftists</label> and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E11">two neo-Nazis</label> were arrested . </p>
<p>Counter-demonstrations against rightist events are common in <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E55">Germany</label> . </p>
<p>But the events have taken on a more urgent tone because of a recent wave of awareness of hate-fueled violence that followed a still-unsolved bomb attack late July in <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E12">North Rhine-Westphalia 0027s capital</label> <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E12">Duesseldorf</label> . </p>
<p>That attack left <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E14">10 recent immigrants</label> injured , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E15">at least six of them Jews</label> , and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E17">at least three people</label> were killed in other hate attacks over the summer . </p>
<p>In the latest attack Friday night , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E18">an Algerian asylum-seeker</label> was stabbed in the arm following an argument about <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E55">Germans</label> and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E20">foreigners</label> with <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E21">two men , aged 19 and 20.</label> <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E22">Dortmund authorities</label> had tried to ban the Saturday <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E59">neo-Nazi</label> march , but <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E25">a court</label> late Friday evening ruled that it could go on . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E61">Clement</label> said the counter-demonstration _ organized by <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E26">citizens 0027 groups</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E27">political parties</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E28">sport clubs</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E29">students</label> and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E30">teachers</label> _ was the kind of involvement by society that would help `` again rub out from <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E55">our country</label> the brown specter from our past , 00270027 referring to the <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E31">Nazis</label> 0027 infamous brownshirts . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E1">Government</label> efforts to stop <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E32">neo-Nazis</label> have focused on banning <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E33">the small , far-right National Democratic Party , blamed for fueling some of the violence</label> . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E35">interior ministers meeting in Berlin</label> delayed a decision on seeking a ban before <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E37">Germany 0027s highest court</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E38">Bavaria Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E38">one of the leading proponents of a ban</label> , told <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E43">Focus newsmagazine</label> in an interview Saturday that <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E38">he</label> was `` firmly convinced 00270027 a legal motion would still be filed this year . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E38">He</label> also raised the possibility of seeking bans about <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E44">Germany 0027s other far-right parties</label> _ <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E44">the Republicans</label> and <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E44">German Peoples Union</label> _ <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E44">both of which</label> have had far more electoral success than <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E33">the politically insignificant NPD</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E47">Some</label> have criticized a potential <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E48">party</label> ban for it they would only drive <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E50">party members</label> underground and make <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E50">them</label> harder to monitor . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E51">Christian Worch</label> of <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E53">Hamburg</label> , <label class="APW20001021.1730.0351-E51">the neo-Nazi who led the Saturday demonstration</label> , gave support to that view . </p>
