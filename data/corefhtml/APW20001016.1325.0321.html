<p>And loans provide a growing chunk of the extra money <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E30"><b>[5]</b>students</label> need to pay for those degrees . </p>
<p>Average in-state tuition and fees at <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E37"><b>[6]</b>public , four-year schools</label> is $ 3,510 per semester _ $ 148 more than last year , according to figures released Monday by <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E14"><b>[7]</b>the College Board</label> . </p>

<p>Room and board on <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E34"><b>[10]</b>campus</label> is now $ 6,209 , a 4.2 percent increase . </p>
<p>Only <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E41"><b>[11]</b>public two-year schools , chiefly community colleges</label> , stayed below the current inflation rate _ but barely . </p>
<p>Tuition rose this year to $ 1,705 , up 3.4 percent , the survey found . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E43"><b>[13]</b>Private two-year schools</label> boosted tuition and fees to $ 7,458 , a 7 percent rise . </p>
<p>This pattern follows an old , familiar trend , said <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E44"><b>[14]</b>Joni Finney</label> , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E44"><b>[15]</b>a policy analyst at the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose , Calif.</label> `` <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E2"><b>[19]</b>Colleges</label> and <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E3"><b>[20]</b>universities</label> have a very difficult time controlling <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E4"><b>[21]</b>their</label> costs , '' <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E44"><b>[22]</b>she</label> said . </p>

<p>'' ... But <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E4"><b>[25]</b>they</label> 've more than made up for lost ground . </p>
<p>'' But <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E5"><b>[26]</b>Stanley Eikenberry</label> , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E5"><b>[27]</b>president of the American Council on Education , an umbrella group for higher education</label> , said in a statement , `` Given the large , fixed costs of <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E9"><b>[30]</b>most campuses</label> , in <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E10"><b>[31]</b>personnel</label> and <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E11"><b>[32]</b>facilities</label> especially , these numbers show <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E12"><b>[33]</b>institutions</label> are working hard to hold the line on increases . </p>
<p>'' The recent increases push past inflation . </p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent in 1999 ; the first eight months of this year , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E17"><b>[34]</b>consumer</label> prices rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent . </p>
<p>Last year , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E13"><b>[35]</b>college</label> tuition and fees rose less than 5 percent . </p>
<p>Despite the increases , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E13"><b>[36]</b>college</label> remains affordable and a good investment , said <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E15"><b>[39]</b>College Board President Gaston Caperton</label> in a statement with the surveys . </p>
<p>`` In both earning potential and learning potential , <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E18"><b>[40]</b>you</label> cannot beat the value of a <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E13"><b>[41]</b>college</label> education , '' <label class="APW20001016.1325.0321-E5"><b>[43]</b>the former West Virginia governor</label> said . </p>
