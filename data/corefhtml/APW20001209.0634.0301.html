<p>Bush Retreating After Court Setback </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E22"><b>[0]</b>AUSTIN , Texas</label> <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E55"><b>[2]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[4]</b>Gov. George W. Bush</label> is retreating to the solitude of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58"><b>[7]</b>his central Texas ranch</label> after a stunning <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[8]</b>court</label> setback in the long drawn-out <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E60"><b>[9]</b>presidential</label> contest . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[11]</b>Texas governor</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[13]</b>Republican nominee</label> was described as in good spirits , but disappointed after Friday 's <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[15]</b>Florida Supreme Court</label> order for an immediate recount of so-called undervotes missed in machine tallies . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2"><b>[17]</b>The dispirited Bush camp</label> had hoped for a victory celebration in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E4"><b>[18]</b>the streets of Austin</label> this weekend . </p>
<p>Instead , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[20]</b>Bush</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E5"><b>[22]</b>his wife</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E5"><b>[23]</b>Laura</label> , were headed back Saturday to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58"><b>[24]</b>the isolated 1,600-acre ranch about a two-hour drive north of here , where he has spent much of his time since the election</label> . </p>
<p>No public appearances were planned throughout the weekend . </p>
<p>And , unlike other recent <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[29]</b>Bush</label> visits to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58"><b>[30]</b>the ranch near Waco , Texas</label> , no plans were made to bring <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E52"><b>[33]</b>reporters</label> out for picture-taking sessions with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E8"><b>[34]</b>prominent visitors</label> or <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E9"><b>[35]</b>would-be members of a Bush Cabinet</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2"><b>[38]</b>We</label> 've run out of reaction , '' <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E11"><b>[41]</b>Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett</label> said Friday night . </p>
<p>`` Obviously , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E13"><b>[42]</b>everybody</label> was disappointed . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E14"><b>[43]</b>Juleanna Glover Weiss</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E14"><b>[44]</b>a spokeswoman in the Bush-Cheney transition headquarters in McLean , Va.</label> , called the development `` just another dip in the roller coaster . </p>
<p>'' But <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E20"><b>[51]</b>Bush officials</label> did little to hide <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E20"><b>[52]</b>their</label> obvious dismay with Friday 's 4-3 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[54]</b>state Supreme Court</label> ruling favoring <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E21"><b>[56]</b>Democrat Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E24"><b>[57]</b>Republicans</label> were briefly buoyed by a pair of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E25"><b>[58]</b>court</label> rulings on absentee ballots that went in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[59]</b>Bush</label> 's favor in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E26"><b>[62]</b>Seminole and Martin counties</label> earlier Friday . </p>
<p>But the upbeat mood quickly evaporated with the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[64]</b>state Supreme Court</label> ruling . </p>
<p>`` Obviously , ( <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[65]</b>Bush</label> ) was a good bit happier after the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E27"><b>[66]</b>Seminole</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E28"><b>[67]</b>Martin</label> decisions than <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[68]</b>he</label> was after this 4-3 decision , '' said <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29"><b>[69]</b>James A. Baker III</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29"><b>[70]</b>the head of Bush 's legal team</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29"><b>[73]</b>a former secretary of state</label> . </p>
<p>Still , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29"><b>[75]</b>he</label> added , `` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[77]</b>Governor Bush</label> is in fine spirits and quite prepared to see this through to its ultimate conclusion because <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[78]</b>he</label> feels very confidently that <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[79]</b>he</label> has won this election and won it more than one time . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[80]</b>Bush</label> went on with a party at <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E32"><b>[82]</b>the governor 's mansion</label> for <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E34"><b>[84]</b>his staff</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E35"><b>[87]</b>his Secret Service detail</label> Friday evening . </p>
<p>Even before the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[88]</b>court</label> setback , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[89]</b>Bush</label> was more muted Friday than <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[90]</b>he</label> has been in days , perhaps reflecting an understanding gleaned from <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E31"><b>[92]</b>his lawyers</label> that <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37"><b>[94]</b>the Florida high court</label> could rule against <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[95]</b>him</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2"><b>[96]</b>We</label> 're prepared , if need be , to take our case back to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E38"><b>[98]</b>the ( U.S. ) Supreme Court</label> , '' <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[99]</b>he</label> told <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E39"><b>[100]</b>reporters</label> . </p>
<p>As to whether <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[101]</b>the trailing candidate</label> should concede the race rather than prolong the process in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E40"><b>[102]</b>the courts</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3"><b>[103]</b>Bush</label> said , `` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E41"><b>[104]</b>Each candidate</label> is going to have to decide to make the decision that 's best for <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E42"><b>[105]</b>the country</label> . </p>
<p>'' As news of Friday 's ruling spread , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E43"><b>[107]</b>pro-Gore demonstrators</label> began to congregate outside <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E32"><b>[109]</b>the governor 's mansion</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E43"><b>[110]</b>They</label> were then matched by <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E45"><b>[111]</b>supporters of Bush and running mate Dick Cheney</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E48"><b>[115]</b>Car</label> horns blared and at times <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E49"><b>[116]</b>competing demonstrators</label> shouted at <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E50"><b>[117]</b>one another</label> . </p>
<p>By nightfall , however , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E49"><b>[118]</b>the demonstrators</label> had all left and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E32"><b>[119]</b>the mansion</label> was quiet _ even though the party was going on inside . </p>
