<p>Bush Retreating After Court Setback </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E22">AUSTIN , Texas</label> <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E55">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Gov. George W. Bush</label> is retreating to the solitude of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58">his central Texas ranch</label> after a stunning <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">court</label> setback in the long drawn-out <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E60">presidential</label> contest . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Texas governor</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Republican nominee</label> was described as in good spirits , but disappointed after Friday 0027s <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">Florida Supreme Court</label> order for an immediate recount of so-called undervotes missed in machine tallies . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2">The dispirited Bush camp</label> had hoped for a victory celebration in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E4">the streets of Austin</label> this weekend . </p>
<p>Instead , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E5">his wife</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E5">Laura</label> , were headed back Saturday to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58">the isolated 1,600-acre ranch about a two-hour drive north of here , where he has spent much of his time since the election</label> . </p>
<p>No public appearances were planned throughout the weekend . </p>
<p>And , unlike other recent <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> visits to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E58">the ranch near Waco , Texas</label> , no plans were made to bring <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E52">reporters</label> out for picture-taking sessions with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E8">prominent visitors</label> or <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E9">would-be members of a Bush Cabinet</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2">We</label> 0027ve run out of reaction , 00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E11">Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett</label> said Friday night . </p>
<p>`` Obviously , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E13">everybody</label> was disappointed . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E14">Juleanna Glover Weiss</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E14">a spokeswoman in the Bush-Cheney transition headquarters in McLean , Va.</label> , called the development `` just another dip in the roller coaster . </p>
<p>00270027 But <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E20">Bush officials</label> did little to hide <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E20">their</label> obvious dismay with Friday 0027s 4-3 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">state Supreme Court</label> ruling favoring <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E21">Democrat Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E24">Republicans</label> were briefly buoyed by a pair of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E25">court</label> rulings on absentee ballots that went in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> 0027s favor in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E26">Seminole and Martin counties</label> earlier Friday . </p>
<p>But the upbeat mood quickly evaporated with the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">state Supreme Court</label> ruling . </p>
<p>`` Obviously , ( <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> ) was a good bit happier after the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E27">Seminole</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E28">Martin</label> decisions than <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">he</label> was after this 4-3 decision , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29">James A. Baker III</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29">the head of Bush 0027s legal team</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29">a former secretary of state</label> . </p>
<p>Still , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E29">he</label> added , `` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Governor Bush</label> is in fine spirits and quite prepared to see this through to its ultimate conclusion because <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">he</label> feels very confidently that <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">he</label> has won this election and won it more than one time . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> went on with a party at <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E32">the governor 0027s mansion</label> for <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E34">his staff</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E35">his Secret Service detail</label> Friday evening . </p>
<p>Even before the <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">court</label> setback , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> was more muted Friday than <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">he</label> has been in days , perhaps reflecting an understanding gleaned from <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E31">his lawyers</label> that <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E37">the Florida high court</label> could rule against <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">him</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E2">We</label> 0027re prepared , if need be , to take our case back to <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E38">the ( U.S. ) Supreme Court</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">he</label> told <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E39">reporters</label> . </p>
<p>As to whether <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">the trailing candidate</label> should concede the race rather than prolong the process in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E40">the courts</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E3">Bush</label> said , `` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E41">Each candidate</label> is going to have to decide to make the decision that 0027s best for <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E42">the country</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 As news of Friday 0027s ruling spread , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E43">pro-Gore demonstrators</label> began to congregate outside <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E32">the governor 0027s mansion</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E43">They</label> were then matched by <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E45">supporters of Bush and running mate Dick Cheney</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E48">Car</label> horns blared and at times <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E49">competing demonstrators</label> shouted at <label class="APW20001209.0634.0301-E50">one another</label> . </p>
