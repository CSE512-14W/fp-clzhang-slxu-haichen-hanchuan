<p>`` Highly civilized , in many ways <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">they</label> articulated the positions of <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E7">their campaigns</label> more effectively than the top of <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">their</label> ticket when <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E3">they</label> met in <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E64">Boston</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E65">Tom Brokaw</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Give it a rave , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E66">CBS anchor Dan Rather</label> . </p>
<p>This will go down as the best vice presidential joint appearance on television since the television era in <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E8">presidential and vice presidential campaigns</label> began . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E1">His colleague</label> , <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E1">Bob Schieffer</label> , wondered whether <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E3">their `` bosses</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E5">George W. Bush</label> and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E6">Al Gore</label> , were watching . </p>
<p>Instant polls and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E9">in-studio audiences</label> also gave <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">the vice presidential candidates</label> high marks . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E10">some observers</label> pronounced <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E10">themselves</label> frustrated by the debate . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E12">Fox News Channel 0027s Mort Kondracke</label> called it `` an opportunity wasted by <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E26">Cheney</label> to go after <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E6">Gore</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 `` Maybe <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E13">somebody</label> could have given <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">the candidates</label> a hot foot or put a joy buzzer on <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">their</label> seat , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E14">his colleague</label> , <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E14">Fred Barnes</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E16">Conservative commentator Bill Kristol , also on FNC</label> , said `` <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E20">the Bush campaign</label> failed to do what <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E20">it</label> had to do ... which to assault <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E6">al Gore</label> 0027s policies and his credibility . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E22">ABC 0027s Sam Donaldson</label> asked plaintively when it was decreed that <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E23">campaigners</label> had to act like `` <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E25">gentlemen</label> and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E24">ladies</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 `` <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E22">I</label> think that 0027s nonsense , 00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E22">Donaldson</label> said . </p>
<p>The night was put in perspective . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E28">ABC anchorman Peter Jennings , who noted that `` bottom of the ticket 00270027 does n0027t necessarily have that much affect on voter decisions</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E32">NBC 0027s Tim Russert</label> of predicted the <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">veep</label> debate 0027s `` effect on the election will practically be nonexistent . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E33">A group of undecided voters recruited by NBC in Tampa , Fla.</label> , were impressed with <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">both candidates</label> _ and , with a non-show of hands , all indicated <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E33">they</label> remained on the fence . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E37">an estimated 46.5 million people</label> watched the first presidential debate between <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E6">Gore</label> and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E5">Bush</label> , which <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E38">some commentators</label> deemed rancorous . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E57">Lieberman</label> and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E26">Cheney</label> were probably on <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E63">their</label> best behavior because <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E39">focus groups</label> told <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E7">the campaigns</label> that conflict does n0027t pay , <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E40">commentators</label> mused . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E37">That Gore-Bush audience</label> was comparable to <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E42">the 46.1 million people who watched the first duel between President Clinton and Bob Dole four years ago</label> , but fell short of the all-time record : <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E46">80 million people</label> watched <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E47">President Carter</label> and <label class="APW20001006.0338.0184-E49">Ronald Reagan</label> square off in 1980 . </p>
