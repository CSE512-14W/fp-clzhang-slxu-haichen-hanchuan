<p>ALL JOKING ASIDE , BUSH FACES LETTERMAN </p>
<p>& UR ; By ALISON MITCHELL & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; </p>
<p>It started like a normal night on the `` Late Show with David Letterman . </p>
<p>'' Expecting <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[1]</b>Gov. George W. Bush</label> as <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[3]</b>his guest</label> , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[4]</b>Letterman</label> quizzed <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E3"><b>[6]</b>an audience member</label> about <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E5"><b>[7]</b>Texas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[8]</b>He</label> showed footage of <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[9]</b>the governor</label> emerging from <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E6"><b>[10]</b>a black car</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[11]</b>He</label> brought up <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[12]</b>Bush</label> 's open mike faux pas about <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E7"><b>[13]</b>a reporter</label> . </p>
<p>But quickly after that <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[14]</b>Letterman</label> had a surprise for <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E8"><b>[15]</b>anyone who was expecting a normal night of comedy</label> _ and from the look of it , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[17]</b>Bush</label> was also surprised . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[18]</b>The host</label> grilled <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[21]</b>the Republican presidential candidate</label> on the death penalty , the bombing of <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E11"><b>[23]</b>a Navy ship in Yemen</label> , violence in <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E14"><b>[25]</b>the Middle East</label> and pollution in <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E5"><b>[26]</b>Texas</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[27]</b>He</label> hardly seemed to be joking , even though <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[28]</b>he</label> punctured <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[29]</b>his</label> questions with <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[30]</b>his</label> trademark laugh . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[31]</b>Bush</label> did get in some good lines . </p>
<p>Asked whether <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[32]</b>he</label> thought <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[33]</b>he</label> had done well in the debate , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[34]</b>he</label> said , `` well <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E15"><b>[35]</b>a lot of folks</label> do n't think <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[36]</b>I</label> can string a sentence together so when <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[37]</b>I</label> was able to do so , the expectations were so low that all <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[38]</b>I</label> had to do was say , ` Hi , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[39]</b>I</label> 'm <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[40]</b>George W. Bush</label> . </p>
<p>'' But soon <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[41]</b>Letterman</label> was bearing in on the death penalty , saying `` <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E16"><b>[42]</b>we</label> make a lot of jokes about <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[43]</b>you</label> electrocuting <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E26"><b>[44]</b>people in Texas</label> '' and asking whether there was some circumstance that would change <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[46]</b>Bush</label> 's position on capital punishment . </p>
<p>`` Well obviously if the system were unfair , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[47]</b>I</label> 'd think about it '' <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[48]</b>Bush</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E17"><b>[49]</b>You</label> know it 's a serious business . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[50]</b>I</label> hope that <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E16"><b>[51]</b>you</label> 're not laughing at the expense of <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E18"><b>[52]</b>victims</label> or <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E19"><b>[53]</b>other people who are put to death</label> of course . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[55]</b>Letterman</label> pressed , `` Nothing <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[56]</b>you</label> can imagine would cause a change of heart here ? </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[57]</b>Bush</label> said <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[58]</b>he</label> might change <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[59]</b>his</label> mind if <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[60]</b>he</label> did not think that executions saved lives . </p>
<p>`` Or perhaps if <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E21"><b>[61]</b>someone</label> were wrongly executed ? </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[62]</b>Letterman</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Well , definitely on that of course , '' allowed <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[63]</b>the governor</label> . </p>
<p>Soon <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E22"><b>[64]</b>the two</label> were debating <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[65]</b>Bush</label> 's plan for oil drilling in <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E23"><b>[66]</b>a nature preserve in Alaska</label> and smog in <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E5"><b>[68]</b>Texas</label> . </p>
<p>`` Do n't you have bad air pollution down in <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E5"><b>[69]</b>Texas</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E2"><b>[70]</b>the host</label> wondered . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[71]</b>Bush</label> said `` it 's getting better '' and noted `` <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E5"><b>[72]</b>we</label> have <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E25"><b>[73]</b>a lot of cars</label> . </p>
<p>'' A taping of a `` Saturday Night Live '' to be shown the weekend before Election Day went more as planned . </p>
<p>But there had to be several retakes because <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[74]</b>Bush , usually a chronic word mangler</label> , could not produce the effect on command . </p>
<p>Told to mispronounce the word `` ambivalent '' for comic effect , <label class="NYT20001019.2136.0319-E1"><b>[76]</b>he</label> kept pronouncing it correctly . </p>
