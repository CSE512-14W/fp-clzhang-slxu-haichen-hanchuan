<p>LENNON 0027S KILLER APOLOGIZED AT PAROLE HEARING , IN VAIN </p>

<p>`` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> do wish <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E27">a big nobody</label> again , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Mark David Chapman</label> told <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">the New York State Parole Board</label> at a closed hearing at <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E31">the Attica state prison</label> on Oct. 3. But <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> words did not sway <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">the board , which , citing his ongoing desire for notoriety , denied Chapman 0027s first bid for parole since he pleaded guilty to the Dec. 8 , 1980 , murder of John Lennon</label> . </p>
<p>In the hearing , a transcript of which was released Wednesday , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> said repeatedly that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> did not have the right to ask for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> release . </p>
<p>But if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> were paroled , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> would try to work on <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E6">a farm</label> , speak at <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E7">churches</label> and be reunited with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E8">his wife , who flies from Hawaii twice a year to visit him</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> said . </p>
<p>In a somewhat rambling apology to <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">Lennon 0027s widow</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">Yoko Ono</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman , 45</label> , said first that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> could not imagine <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">her</label> pain , and later that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had felt it for the first time after reading a recent <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E12">Newsweek</label> article in which <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">she</label> said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">she</label> had been shaking uncontrollably the night of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">her husband</label> 0027s death . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> 0027ve come to grips with the fact that that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">John Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">a person</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> told <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">the board</label> that after reading the article , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had almost skipped the hearing . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">You</label> have a right to know what happened . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> would have been up for parole even if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had not attended , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E13">a parole board spokesman</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10">Ono</label> did not attend the hearing , but had submitted a letter asking that parole be denied . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman , who has been criticized for seeming to revel in televised appearances after his conviction</label> , was consistently self-deprecating throughout the 50-minute hearing . </p>
<p>Describing an outburst early in <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> incarceration , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> said : `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E14">They</label> were rough with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">me</label> , which was fine . </p>
<p>Which is probably what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> needed to snap out of that . </p>
<p>00270027 Asked if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> would be concerned for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> safety if released , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman , who is being held in protective custody apart from other inmates</label> , said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> believed that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16">God</label> `` kept the lions 0027 mouths shut in <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E18">Daniel 0027s den</label> , 00270027 adding , `` And <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> think <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16">he</label> can do the same for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">me</label> if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16">he</label> so chooses , and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> would leave most of that up to <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16">him</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> 0027s pursuit of publicity occupied much of the discussion , despite <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> professed wish to return to the anonymity that had plagued <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">him</label> , as <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">a security guard in Hawaii</label> , enough to make <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">him</label> commit <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> notorious crime . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">the board</label> denied parole in a written statement issued shortly after the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">it</label> said : `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Your</label> most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">your</label> need to be acknowledged . </p>
<p>During <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">your</label> parole hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">this panel</label> noted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">your</label> continued interest in maintaining <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">your</label> notoriety . </p>
<p>00270027 Asked what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had done to attract attention since <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> was incarcerated , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> recalled a 1987 interview with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E20">People magazine</label> , for which <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> received $ 5,000 , according to news reports at the time . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">He</label> also recalled interviews with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E21">Barbara Walters</label> and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E22">Larry King</label> when a book about <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">him</label> was published in 1992 . </p>
<p>`` Other than that , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> 0027ve consistently , especially the last 10 years , denied any press requests . </p>
<p>00270027 But when prompted , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> did acknowledge a three-hour interview in July with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">Jack Jones</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">a Rochester journalist who wrote the 1992 book `` Let Me Take You Down : Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman , the Man Who Killed John Lennon 00270027 ( Villard Books</label> ) . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">Jones , reached by telephone Wednesday</label> , said that in the July interview , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> had told <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">him</label> for the first time that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> wanted to be released from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E31">prison</label> . </p>
<p>But after the hearing last week , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> was relieved that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">they</label> made the decision that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5">they</label> made , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">Jones , who spoke to him then</label> . </p>
<p>The interview was conducted for the book 0027s newly published second edition . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> said that after getting permission from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16">God</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had allowed parts of it to be released to Court TV . </p>
<p>In the interview , parts of which were also published in The Daily Express of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E26">London</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> made the widely publicized remark that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">a liberal</label> and would have wanted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">him</label> to be released . </p>
<p>But at the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">the inmate</label> complained that the comment had been wrongly portrayed , and that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">he</label> had not meant it as an argument in favor of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">his</label> parole . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23">He</label> asked <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">me</label> , what did <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> think <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2">John Lennon</label> would do , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">Chapman</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> thought about it for a minute , and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1">I</label> answered honestly . </p>
