<p>In the hearing , a transcript of which was released Wednesday , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[16]</b>Chapman</label> said repeatedly that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[17]</b>he</label> did not have the right to ask for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[18]</b>his</label> release . </p>

<p>`` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[41]</b>I</label> 've come to grips with the fact that that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[42]</b>John Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[43]</b>a person</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[44]</b>he</label> said . </p>

<p>But <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[48]</b>he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[49]</b>You</label> have a right to know what happened . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[50]</b>Chapman</label> would have been up for parole even if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[51]</b>he</label> had not attended , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E13"><b>[53]</b>a parole board spokesman</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[54]</b>Ono</label> did not attend the hearing , but had submitted a letter asking that parole be denied . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[55]</b>Chapman , who has been criticized for seeming to revel in televised appearances after his conviction</label> , was consistently self-deprecating throughout the 50-minute hearing . </p>

<p>Which is probably what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[62]</b>I</label> needed to snap out of that . </p>

<p>'' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[78]</b>Chapman</label> 's pursuit of publicity occupied much of the discussion , despite <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[79]</b>his</label> professed wish to return to the anonymity that had plagued <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[80]</b>him</label> , as <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[81]</b>a security guard in Hawaii</label> , enough to make <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[83]</b>him</label> commit <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[84]</b>his</label> notorious crime . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[85]</b>the board</label> denied parole in a written statement issued shortly after the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[86]</b>it</label> said : `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[87]</b>Your</label> most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[88]</b>your</label> need to be acknowledged . </p>
<p>During <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[89]</b>your</label> parole hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[90]</b>this panel</label> noted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[91]</b>your</label> continued interest in maintaining <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[92]</b>your</label> notoriety . </p>
<p>'' Asked what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[93]</b>he</label> had done to attract attention since <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[94]</b>he</label> was incarcerated , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[95]</b>Chapman</label> recalled a 1987 interview with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E20"><b>[96]</b>People magazine</label> , for which <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[97]</b>he</label> received $ 5,000 , according to news reports at the time . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[98]</b>He</label> also recalled interviews with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E21"><b>[99]</b>Barbara Walters</label> and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E22"><b>[100]</b>Larry King</label> when a book about <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[101]</b>him</label> was published in 1992 . </p>
<p>`` Other than that , '' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[102]</b>he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[103]</b>I</label> 've consistently , especially the last 10 years , denied any press requests . </p>
<p>'' But when prompted , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[104]</b>Chapman</label> did acknowledge a three-hour interview in July with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[105]</b>Jack Jones</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[107]</b>a Rochester journalist who wrote the 1992 book `` Let Me Take You Down : Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman , the Man Who Killed John Lennon '' ( Villard Books</label> ) . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[110]</b>Jones , reached by telephone Wednesday</label> , said that in the July interview , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[111]</b>Chapman</label> had told <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[112]</b>him</label> for the first time that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[113]</b>he</label> wanted to be released from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E31"><b>[114]</b>prison</label> . </p>
<p>But after the hearing last week , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[115]</b>he</label> was relieved that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[116]</b>they</label> made the decision that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[117]</b>they</label> made , '' said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[118]</b>Jones , who spoke to him then</label> . </p>
<p>The interview was conducted for the book 's newly published second edition . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[121]</b>Chapman</label> said that after getting permission from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[122]</b>God</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[123]</b>he</label> had allowed parts of it to be released to Court TV . </p>
<p>In the interview , parts of which were also published in The Daily Express of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E26"><b>[124]</b>London</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[125]</b>Chapman</label> made the widely publicized remark that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[126]</b>Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[127]</b>a liberal</label> and would have wanted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[128]</b>him</label> to be released . </p>
<p>But at the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[129]</b>the inmate</label> complained that the comment had been wrongly portrayed , and that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[130]</b>he</label> had not meant it as an argument in favor of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[131]</b>his</label> parole . </p>
