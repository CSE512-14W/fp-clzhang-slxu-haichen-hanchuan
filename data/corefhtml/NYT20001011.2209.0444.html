<p>In the hearing , a transcript of which was released Wednesday , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[8]</b>Chapman</label> said repeatedly that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[9]</b>he</label> did not have the right to ask for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[10]</b>his</label> release . </p>

<p>In a somewhat rambling apology to <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[17]</b>Lennon 's widow</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[18]</b>Yoko Ono</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[19]</b>Chapman , 45</label> , said first that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[20]</b>he</label> could not imagine <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[21]</b>her</label> pain , and later that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[22]</b>he</label> had felt it for the first time after reading a recent <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E12"><b>[23]</b>Newsweek</label> article in which <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[24]</b>she</label> said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[25]</b>she</label> had been shaking uncontrollably the night of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[26]</b>her husband</label> 's death . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[27]</b>I</label> 've come to grips with the fact that that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[28]</b>John Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[29]</b>a person</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[30]</b>he</label> said . </p>

<p>But <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[34]</b>he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[35]</b>You</label> have a right to know what happened . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[36]</b>Chapman</label> would have been up for parole even if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[37]</b>he</label> had not attended , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E13"><b>[38]</b>a parole board spokesman</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E10"><b>[39]</b>Ono</label> did not attend the hearing , but had submitted a letter asking that parole be denied . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[40]</b>Chapman , who has been criticized for seeming to revel in televised appearances after his conviction</label> , was consistently self-deprecating throughout the 50-minute hearing . </p>

<p>Which is probably what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[45]</b>I</label> needed to snap out of that . </p>
<p>'' Asked if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[46]</b>he</label> would be concerned for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[47]</b>his</label> safety if released , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[48]</b>Chapman , who is being held in protective custody apart from other inmates</label> , said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[49]</b>he</label> believed that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[50]</b>God</label> `` kept the lions ' mouths shut in <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E18"><b>[51]</b>Daniel 's den</label> , '' adding , `` And <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[52]</b>I</label> think <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[53]</b>he</label> can do the same for <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[54]</b>me</label> if <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[55]</b>he</label> so chooses , and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[56]</b>I</label> would leave most of that up to <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[57]</b>him</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[58]</b>Chapman</label> 's pursuit of publicity occupied much of the discussion , despite <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[59]</b>his</label> professed wish to return to the anonymity that had plagued <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[60]</b>him</label> , as <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[61]</b>a security guard in Hawaii</label> , enough to make <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[62]</b>him</label> commit <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[63]</b>his</label> notorious crime . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[64]</b>the board</label> denied parole in a written statement issued shortly after the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[65]</b>it</label> said : `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[66]</b>Your</label> most vicious and violent act was apparently fueled by <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[67]</b>your</label> need to be acknowledged . </p>
<p>During <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[68]</b>your</label> parole hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[69]</b>this panel</label> noted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[70]</b>your</label> continued interest in maintaining <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[71]</b>your</label> notoriety . </p>
<p>'' Asked what <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[72]</b>he</label> had done to attract attention since <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[73]</b>he</label> was incarcerated , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[74]</b>Chapman</label> recalled a 1987 interview with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E20"><b>[75]</b>People magazine</label> , for which <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[76]</b>he</label> received $ 5,000 , according to news reports at the time . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[77]</b>He</label> also recalled interviews with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E21"><b>[78]</b>Barbara Walters</label> and <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E22"><b>[79]</b>Larry King</label> when a book about <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[80]</b>him</label> was published in 1992 . </p>
<p>`` Other than that , '' <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[81]</b>he</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[82]</b>I</label> 've consistently , especially the last 10 years , denied any press requests . </p>
<p>'' But when prompted , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[83]</b>Chapman</label> did acknowledge a three-hour interview in July with <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[84]</b>Jack Jones</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[85]</b>a Rochester journalist who wrote the 1992 book `` Let Me Take You Down : Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman , the Man Who Killed John Lennon '' ( Villard Books</label> ) . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[86]</b>Jones , reached by telephone Wednesday</label> , said that in the July interview , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[87]</b>Chapman</label> had told <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[88]</b>him</label> for the first time that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[89]</b>he</label> wanted to be released from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E31"><b>[90]</b>prison</label> . </p>
<p>But after the hearing last week , `` <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[91]</b>he</label> was relieved that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[92]</b>they</label> made the decision that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E5"><b>[93]</b>they</label> made , '' said <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E23"><b>[94]</b>Jones , who spoke to him then</label> . </p>
<p>The interview was conducted for the book 's newly published second edition . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[95]</b>Chapman</label> said that after getting permission from <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E16"><b>[96]</b>God</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[97]</b>he</label> had allowed parts of it to be released to Court TV . </p>
<p>In the interview , parts of which were also published in The Daily Express of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E26"><b>[98]</b>London</label> , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[99]</b>Chapman</label> made the widely publicized remark that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[100]</b>Lennon</label> was <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E2"><b>[101]</b>a liberal</label> and would have wanted <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[102]</b>him</label> to be released . </p>
<p>But at the hearing , <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[103]</b>the inmate</label> complained that the comment had been wrongly portrayed , and that <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[104]</b>he</label> had not meant it as an argument in favor of <label class="NYT20001011.2209.0444-E1"><b>[105]</b>his</label> parole . </p>
