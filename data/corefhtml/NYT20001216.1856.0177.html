<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E8">The Vatican spokesman</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E8">Joaquin Navarro-Valls</label> , explained that <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E11">Bishop Egon Kapellari of Carinthia</label> spoke with <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> for a few minutes before the meeting only to exchange greetings . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider , who seems to relish even hostile attention</label> , walked across <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E14">St. Peter 0027s Square</label> to <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E90">the Vatican</label> from <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E15">his nearby hotel</label> separately from <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E16">the rest of the delegation , which included his wife and two children</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">He</label> was surrounded by <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E18">a tense phalanx of security officers and jostling cameramen</label> . </p>
<p>For weeks <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E23">Italian Jewish groups</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E24">World War II veterans</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E25">leftist political parties</label> have staged protests against a meeting between <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> , arguing that a papal encounter would lend <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">the Austrian politician</label> legitimacy . </p>
<p>On Saturday , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E26">about 1,000 students</label> marched in <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E27">another section of central Rome</label> , carrying banners that read `` <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> ? </p>
<p>No thank <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E29">you</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 No demonstrations were allowed near <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E30">St. Peter 0027s</label> , and security around the tree , which was erected in the middle of <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E14">St. Peter 0027s Square</label> , was discreetly tightened . </p>
<p>After <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> left <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E31">the area</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E32">scores of protesters</label> clashed with <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E33">riot police , who fired tear gas to disperse the crowds</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E36">Four people</label> were slightly injured and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E37">two</label> were detained , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E38">the Italian news agency</label> <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E38">ANSA</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E40">Jewish merchants in Rome</label> announced <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E40">they</label> would turn off their lights to protest <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> 0027s presence in <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E12">Rome</label> . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E41">reporters</label> asked <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> about this action , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">he</label> retorted , `` If <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E40">they</label> want to save electricity , let <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E40">them</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Inside <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E42">an ornate reception room in the papal apartments</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">a Roman Catholic</label> , kissed <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> 0027s ring and sat in the front row with <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E44">other dignitaries</label> facing <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> 0027s armchair . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> wore a blue business suit , but <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E45">many in his group</label> wore traditional costumes and sang Christmas carols . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">The pope</label> thanked <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E46">the visitors</label> for the tree but made no mention of such issues as racism and immigration , which have tracked <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> 0027s tense visit to <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E21">Italy</label> . </p>
<p>A copy of <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> 0027s recently released New Year 0027s Day message of peace , which calls for <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E48">countries</label> to welcome <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E49">immigrants</label> and avoid intolerance , was distributed to <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E50">leaders of the delegation</label> . </p>
<p>After the meeting , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> told <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E51">reporters</label> that <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">he</label> had not discussed political issues with <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> , that <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">John Paul II</label> had given <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E4">the group</label> a `` warm welcome 00270027 and that `` <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">he</label> seemed very happy with the gift . </p>
<p>00270027 Indeed , in the past <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E63">the pope</label> has stirred controversy by meeting with <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E52">former U.N. secretary-general Kurt Waldheim , whose activities in the Nazi era came under question</label> , and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E56">Fidel Castro</label> . </p>
<p>( BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM ) When <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> arrived in <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E57">Venice</label> earlier this week , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E58">protesters on boats</label> threw <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E60">stones</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E61">fireworks</label> along <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E62">the canals</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> 0027s comments criticizing <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E21">Italy</label> 0027s immigration policy as `` too generous 00270027 were denounced by <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E64">President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi</label> . </p>
<p>The comments set off an election campaign storm , as <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E66">leaders of Italy 0027s left-wing government</label> leveraged the dislike of <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> to cast a shadow on <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E67">Italy 0027s own right-wing parties</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E72">The coalition of Italy 0027s center-right opposition</label> includes <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E69">the formerly separatist and still fiercely right-wing party</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E69">the Northern League , which , like Haider 0027s Freedom Party , opposes immigration</label> . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E73">Prime Minister Giuliano Amato</label> denounced <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">Haider</label> 0027s comments as `` unacceptable 00270027 and said <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E73">he</label> would complain to <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E75">Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of Austria</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E21">Italy</label> is not <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E77">the only European country to have fierce reservations about Haider</label> , but <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E21">it</label> has had more direct exposure . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E1">The Austrian leader</label> has made several visits to <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E68">northern Italy , where his friendship with some right-wing mayors _ and suggestions that southern Austria and parts of northern Italy should merge into a `` maxi-region 00270027 _ have enraged Italy 0027s center-left government</label> . </p>
<p>( END OPTIONAL TRIM ) <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E83">Some people in Haider 0027s delegation</label> said <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E83">they</label> were disappointed by the clamor surrounding Saturday 0027s visit . </p>
<p>`` The Christmas tree has nothing to do with politics , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E84">Frank Telsnig</label> , 22 , <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E84">a teacher from Weitensfeld</label> , as <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E84">he</label> prepared to play saxophone in <label class="NYT20001216.1856.0177-E88">the delegation 0027s band</label> . </p>
