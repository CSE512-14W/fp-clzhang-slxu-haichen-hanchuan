<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E59"><b>[7]</b>The steps leading down to the tomb</label> are strewn with stones chipped off the walls . </p>
<p>The top of the dome is smashed through in two places . </p>
<p>Inside <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[9]</b>the tomb</label> , soggy books , burned sleeping bags and scattered cans of food litter the muddy floor , and the walls are charred black from fire . </p>
<p>But the stone sarcophagus is untouched , perhaps the one object still respected at <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[10]</b>this holy site , revered by some as the burial place of the biblical patriarch</label> . </p>
