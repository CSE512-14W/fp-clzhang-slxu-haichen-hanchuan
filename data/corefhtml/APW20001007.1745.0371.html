<p>W. Bank Holy Site Destroyed by War </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E14">NABLUS , West Bank</label> <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E64">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">Joseph 0027s Tomb</label> , <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the flashpoint in a week of bitter West Bank clashes</label> , is now <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">a casualty of war</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E59">The steps leading down to the tomb</label> are strewn with stones chipped off the walls . </p>
<p>The top of the dome is smashed through in two places . </p>
<p>Inside <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the tomb</label> , soggy books , burned sleeping bags and scattered cans of food litter the muddy floor , and the walls are charred black from fire . </p>
<p>But the stone sarcophagus is untouched , perhaps the one object still respected at <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">this holy site , revered by some as the burial place of the biblical patriarch</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">The compound</label> was <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">home to a Jewish seminary , where about 30 students would study during the day</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E73">The Israeli army</label> evacuated <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the outpost</label> before dawn on Saturday , after clashes <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">there</label> last week killed <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E1">six Palestinians</label> and <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E2">an Israeli border policeman</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E70">The seminary</label> had been closed during the violence . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E5">Palestinian security officials</label> were left standing guard as <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E6">hundreds of Palestinians</label> converged on <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E7">the square in front of the site</label> , cheering the withdrawal . </p>
<p>With the arrival of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E8">dozens of Palestinian gunmen</label> , the celebration degenerated into a trashing of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the compound</label> , with <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E63">crowds</label> vandalizing <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the tomb</label> , setting fires and hammering away at <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E9">the stone buildings</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E10">We</label> did it so <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E11">the Jews</label> never come back , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E12">Haitham Najid Kabee , 14 , who vandalized the tomb with his friends</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E15">Nablus Gov. Mahmoud Aloul</label> came to <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E7">the square</label> to plead with <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E17">the vandals</label> to stop . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E18">We</label> should protect <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">this building</label> and make <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">it</label> a symbol for <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E21">our martyrs who were killed defending it</label> , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E15">Aloul , whose son was killed in clashes last week</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E18">We</label> will stop <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">here</label> <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E18">together</label> and prevent <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E24">any Jews</label> from coming back to <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">this place</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 But <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E15">the governor</label> 0027s call went unheeded . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E25">Demonstrators</label> threw <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E72">Jewish</label> prayer books from <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the tomb</label> , burning and tearing them . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E26">Some laughing teens</label> walked out of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the compound</label> wearing <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E35">Israeli</label> helmets and vests found inside . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E28">Dozens</label> climbed on the roof of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">the tomb</label> and began hammering , breaking off chunks of rock . </p>
<p>By late afternoon , <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E29">firefighters</label> had put out three fires in <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the compound</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E27">People</label> still wandered curiously around <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the small enclave , now topped by a large flag of the radical Islamic group Hamas , and a smaller Palestinian flag</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E33">I</label> am very happy , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E33">Nidal Abdel Jawad , 40.</label> `` It was still occupation as long as <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E34">they</label> were <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">here</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 The withdrawal of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E34">troops</label> from <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">the tomb</label> marked the first time <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E35">Israel</label> has relinquished <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E36">territory</label> as a direct result of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E4">Palestinian</label> violence . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E37">Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh</label> said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the enclave</label> had become <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">a liability</label> . </p>
<p>But after the destruction that followed the withdrawal , <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E40">Israeli officials</label> were furious . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E41">The Palestinians</label> betrayed <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E41">their</label> commitment and have let <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">this shrine</label> fall into the hands of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E42">the mob waiting outside</label> , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E43">Israeli government spokesman Nahman Shai</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E43">He</label> said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E35">the government</label> `` deeply deplores 00270027 the trashing of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">the tomb</label> . </p>
<p>A statement by <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E45">the 15-member European Union</label> also condemned the destruction . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E19">The tomb</label> 0027s holiness is disputed , as tradition holds that <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E47">Joseph</label> was actually buried in <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E48">Egypt</label> ; the connection of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">the site</label> to <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E47">Joseph</label> is a relatively recent local <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E49">Arab</label> tradition also observed by <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E50">some Jews</label> . </p>
<p>`` What <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E51">I</label> want to understand is if <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E47">Joseph</label> is not buried <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">there</label> , why <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39">this place</label> was so important , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E51">Abdul Fateh Sayed , 62 , whose bookstore across the street was hit by stray bullets in the fighting</label> . </p>
