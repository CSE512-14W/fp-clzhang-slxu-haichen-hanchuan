<p><label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E59"><b>[5]</b>The steps leading down to the tomb</label> are strewn with stones chipped off the walls . </p>
<p>The top of the dome is smashed through in two places . </p>
<p>Inside <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[6]</b>the tomb</label> , soggy books , burned sleeping bags and scattered cans of food litter the muddy floor , and the walls are charred black from fire . </p>
<p>But the stone sarcophagus is untouched , perhaps the one object still respected at <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[7]</b>this holy site , revered by some as the burial place of the biblical patriarch</label> . </p>

<p>With the arrival of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E8"><b>[19]</b>dozens of Palestinian gunmen</label> , the celebration degenerated into a trashing of <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[20]</b>the compound</label> , with <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E63"><b>[21]</b>crowds</label> vandalizing <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E39"><b>[22]</b>the tomb</label> , setting fires and hammering away at <label class="APW20001007.1745.0371-E9"><b>[23]</b>the stone buildings</label> . </p>
