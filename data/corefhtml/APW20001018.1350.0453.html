<p>Social Security Checks To Jump </p>
<p><label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E23">WASHINGTON</label> <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E26">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E27">The 45.2 million Americans getting Social Security checks</label> will see them grow by 3.5 percent next year , the biggest cost-of-living increase in almost a decade . </p>
<p>That 0027s because inflation has picked up speed , almost entirely a reflection of surging energy prices . </p>
<p>The increases , which will begin showing up in benefit payments for January , were announced by <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E15">Social Security</label> based on inflation figures released Wednesday by <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E29">the Labor Department</label> . </p>
<p>The cost-of-living announcement comes just weeks before <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E22">Americans</label> elect <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E30">a new president</label> Nov. 7. <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E31">Florida and Pennsylvania _ among the tossup states in the presidential race</label> _ have <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E34">a large number of older people , who tend to be the most likely to vote</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E1">Texas Gov. George W. Bush</label> , <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E1">the Republican presidential nominee</label> , and <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E3">Vice President Al Gore</label> , <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E3">the Democrat</label> , have repeatedly clashed over Social Security . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E1">Bush</label> proposes allowing <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E35">individuals</label> some control over how to invest <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E35">their</label> retirement funds , while <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E3">Gore</label> says that would threaten the long-term solvency of <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E22">the nation</label> 0027s huge retirement system . </p>
<p>The 3.5 percent increase was the largest since a 3.7 percent rise in 1992 . </p>
<p>It means the average monthly check for <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E6">retirees</label> will rise by $ 29 to $ 845 next year , up from $ 816 this year . </p>
<p>That compares with an increase of 2.4 percent for 2000 , which translated into an average of $ 19 a month more for <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E6">retirees</label> . </p>
<p>In addition to retirement checks , the increases affect Social Security benefits paid to <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E7">disabled workers</label> and <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E8">families whose breadwinners have died</label> . </p>
<p>The maximum monthly payment for <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E10">low-income individuals</label> receiving Supplemental Security Income , known as SSI , also will rise by 3.5 percent . </p>
<p>That will boost the maximum monthly SSI check by $ 18 to $ 530 . </p>
<p>For <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E11">a couple</label> , the SSI maximum goes up $ 27 to $ 796 . </p>
<p>Increased payments to <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E12">SSI recipients</label> will begin on Dec. 29. `` The annual cost-of-living adjustment is one of the most critically important features of the Social Security program , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E13">Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel</label> . </p>
<p>`` For <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E16">the elderly</label> , it guarantees that <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E16">their</label> foundation of retirement income will remain strong for as long as <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E16">they</label> live . </p>
<p>00270027 Separately , <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E17">the Department of Health and Human Services</label> announced that the monthly Medicare premium deducted from <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E18">most elderly and disabled Americans</label> 0027 Social Security checks for insurance coverage of <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E20">doctors 0027 office</label> visits will increase by $ 4.50 to $ 50 in 2001 . </p>
<p>The increase , which takes effect Jan. 1 , reflects higher health-care costs and changes in Medicare law . </p>
<p>It is not based on the cost-of-living adjustment tied to the CPI . </p>
<p>Since 1975 , the benefit cost-of-living adjustment has been automatic , requiring no vote by <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E21">Congress</label> . </p>
<p>It is calculated based on changes in the Consumer Price Index _ <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E22">the government</label> 0027s inflation yardstick _ from the third quarter of one year to the corresponding quarter of the next . </p>
<p>Because of tame inflation , the yearly benefit boosts have been below 3.0 percent since 1994 . </p>
<p>The 1999 increase of 1.3 percent , matched a record low set in 1987 . </p>
<p>More recently , <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E24">consumer</label> prices have been edging up , largely because of higher energy costs . </p>
<p>Crude-oil prices hit a 10-year high in September , contributing to costlier gasoline and heating oil . </p>
<p>While overall inflation is rising , it is still moderate compared with other periods . </p>
<p>Double-digit inflation in the late 1970s , for example , drove the cost-of-living increase up to 14.3 percent in 1980 . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E15">Social Security</label> also announced Wednesday that for <label class="APW20001018.1350.0453-E25">working Americans</label> , the maximum annual earnings subject to Social Security taxes next year will rise to $ 80,400 from $ 76,200 . </p>
<p>That limit along with the Social Security tax rate of 6.2 percent is set by law . </p>
