<p><label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34">Dooley</label> said last month <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15">the coach</label> would not be fired even though <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">the Bulldogs</label> fell short of preseason predictions that had <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">them</label> winning <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E29">SEC 0027s East</label> . </p>
<p>Criticism of <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15">Donnan</label> increased a week later , after <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5">Georgia Tech</label> beat <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">Georgia</label> for the third straight year , <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">the Bulldogs</label> 0027 longest losing streak in the bitter rivalry since the early 1960s . </p>
<p>A win over <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5">Georgia Tech</label> would have put <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">Georgia</label> in position for a New Year 0027s Day bowl game , but the loss left <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26">the No. 24 Bulldogs</label> in the Oahu Bowl against <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E6">Virginia</label> . </p>
