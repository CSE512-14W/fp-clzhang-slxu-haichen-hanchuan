<p>`` <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E32"><b>[20]</b>I</label> 'm a little bit shocked . </p>
<p>It 's an unsettling feeling . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[22]</b>Athletic director Vince Dooley</label> had given <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[23]</b>Donnan</label> a vote of confidence just last month . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E31"><b>[24]</b>the players</label> said <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[25]</b>Dooley</label> told <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E31"><b>[26]</b>them</label> that <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E1"><b>[29]</b>school president Michael Adams</label> made the decision to fire <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[30]</b>Donnan</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E4"><b>[31]</b>The athletic department</label> scheduled a late afternoon to discuss the program but details were not disclosed . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[32]</b>Dooley</label> said last month <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[33]</b>the coach</label> would not be fired even though <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[34]</b>the Bulldogs</label> fell short of preseason predictions that had <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[35]</b>them</label> winning <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E29"><b>[36]</b>SEC 's East</label> . </p>
<p>Criticism of <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[37]</b>Donnan</label> increased a week later , after <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5"><b>[38]</b>Georgia Tech</label> beat <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[39]</b>Georgia</label> for the third straight year , <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[40]</b>the Bulldogs</label> ' longest losing streak in the bitter rivalry since the early 1960s . </p>
<p>A win over <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5"><b>[41]</b>Georgia Tech</label> would have put <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[42]</b>Georgia</label> in position for a New Year 's Day bowl game , but the loss left <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[43]</b>the No. 24 Bulldogs</label> in the Oahu Bowl against <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E6"><b>[44]</b>Virginia</label> . </p>

<p>If not , <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E32"><b>[50]</b>Phillips</label> said , <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E31"><b>[51]</b>players</label> were considering voting against accepting the bid . </p>
