<p>It 's an unsettling feeling . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[11]</b>Athletic director Vince Dooley</label> had given <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[12]</b>Donnan</label> a vote of confidence just last month . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E31"><b>[13]</b>the players</label> said <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[14]</b>Dooley</label> told <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E31"><b>[15]</b>them</label> that <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E1"><b>[16]</b>school president Michael Adams</label> made the decision to fire <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[17]</b>Donnan</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E4"><b>[18]</b>The athletic department</label> scheduled a late afternoon to discuss the program but details were not disclosed . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E34"><b>[19]</b>Dooley</label> said last month <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[20]</b>the coach</label> would not be fired even though <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[21]</b>the Bulldogs</label> fell short of preseason predictions that had <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[22]</b>them</label> winning <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E29"><b>[23]</b>SEC 's East</label> . </p>
<p>Criticism of <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E15"><b>[24]</b>Donnan</label> increased a week later , after <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5"><b>[25]</b>Georgia Tech</label> beat <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[26]</b>Georgia</label> for the third straight year , <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[27]</b>the Bulldogs</label> ' longest losing streak in the bitter rivalry since the early 1960s . </p>
<p>A win over <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E5"><b>[28]</b>Georgia Tech</label> would have put <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[29]</b>Georgia</label> in position for a New Year 's Day bowl game , but the loss left <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E26"><b>[30]</b>the No. 24 Bulldogs</label> in the Oahu Bowl against <label class="APW20001204.2149.0765-E6"><b>[31]</b>Virginia</label> . </p>
