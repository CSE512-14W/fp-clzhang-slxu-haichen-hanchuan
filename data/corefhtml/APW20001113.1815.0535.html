<p><label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34"><b>[8]</b>Brian Kain , a 33-year-old accountant and sailing enthusiast</label> , eagerly opened a large envelope when it arrived Saturday with some information about navigation charts that <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34"><b>[11]</b>he</label> had ordered from <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E37"><b>[12]</b>a company based in the state of Washington</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34"><b>[15]</b>He</label> assumed two extra sealed yellow envelopes inside the package were ads and planned to throw them away until <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E2"><b>[16]</b>his wife , Helle</label> , opened one of them to discover the absentee ballot of <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E4"><b>[18]</b>Steven H.
