<p><label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34">Brian Kain , a 33-year-old accountant and sailing enthusiast</label> , eagerly opened a large envelope when it arrived Saturday with some information about navigation charts that <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34">he</label> had ordered from <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E37">a company based in the state of Washington</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E34">He</label> assumed two extra sealed yellow envelopes inside the package were ads and planned to throw them away until <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E2">his wife , Helle</label> , opened one of them to discover the absentee ballot of <label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E4">Steven H.

<p><label class="APW20001113.1815.0535-E30">The Kains</label> did n't open the second envelope but assumed it also was a ballot since both were marked with the words `` Official ballot _ do not delay . </p>
