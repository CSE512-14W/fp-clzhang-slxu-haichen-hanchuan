<p>But then subtlety is not a trait of <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E52">political cartoonists , a trade that Block _ better known as Herblock _ has plied for the past 71 years</label> . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E17">Few Herblock targets</label> , however , were as favored as <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E2">Nixon , drawn with deep-set , malevolent eyes , five o 0027clock shadow and , when he was vice president in Eisenhower 0027s administration , with a bloodstained hatchet in hand</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">Herblock</label> offered a truce when <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E2">Nixon</label> was elected <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E2">president</label> in 1968 . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">He</label> gave <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E2">Nixon</label> a shave . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">Herblock</label> also was <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E21">an unrelenting opponent of Sen. Joe McCarthy</label> , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">the artist</label> coined the term McCarthyism . </p>
<p>For a March 29 , 1950 , cartoon <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">he</label> drew <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E25">four Republican stalwarts</label> hauling a reluctant <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E26">GOP</label> elephant toward a teetering stack of tar buckets , topped by a dripping barrel labeled `` McCarthyism 00270027 and a little platform above that . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">He</label> and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E6">the library</label> agree that was the origin of the word _ `` with no thought of creating a new term , 00270027 <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">Herblock</label> wrote later . </p>
<p>In the caption , the elephant says : `` <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E27">You</label> mean I 0027m supposed to stand on that ? </p>
<p>00270027 Still , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E23">McCarthy</label> , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">Herblock</label> noted , even adopted the term as a title for a book `` McCarthyism : The Fight for America . </p>

<p>To that , <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">the artist</label> said : `` Yes , and <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E51">I</label> hope <label class="APW20001017.1313.0395-E36">they</label> will be saying 0027That was a good one this morning . </p>
