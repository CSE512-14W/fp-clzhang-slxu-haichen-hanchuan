<p>`` One more day ! </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E12">they</label> roared . </p>
<p>`` One more day ! </p>
<p>00270027 What <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E5">the nation</label> needed , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> told <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E12">them</label> , was `` <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E13">a president who can unite this nation</label> , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E13">a president who puts aside the endless partisan bickering that seems to gridlock our nation 0027s capitol</label> , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E13">a president who puts the people first</label> , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E13">a president who lifts this nation 0027s spirits</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">I</label> 0027ll be <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E13">that president</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">he</label> added , a sentence that was equal parts promise and prediction . </p>
<p>It underscored the optimism that <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> has , from the very beginning , sought to project to <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E17">voters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">His</label> schedule over the course of a 16-hour day was also an expression of that confidence . </p>
<p>In between <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E43">Tennessee</label> and <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E47">Arkansas</label> , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E18">his campaign plane</label> touched down in <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E19">Wisconsin</label> and <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E20">Iowa</label> , and while <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E21">any one of those four states</label> could wind up providing the key to a <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> victory , none have as many electoral votes as <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E24">such battlegrounds as Michigan and Pennsylvania</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E22">they</label> are <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E22">genuine tossups that were initially predicted to be much more hospitable to Gore</label> . </p>
<p>By visiting <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E22">them</label> Monday , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> emphasized the breadth of <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">his</label> appeal and the sometimes surprising vulnerability of <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E49">the vice president</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">He</label> did not let <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">his</label> assertion of strength and confidence distract <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">him</label> from the important business of beseeching <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E28">supporters</label> to grant <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">him</label> victory . </p>
<p>With just 24 hours before Election Day , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> in many ways stripped campaigning to its essence : coaxing and cajoling , pleading and persuading . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">I</label> want <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">you</label> to understand that <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">I</label> ca n0027t win without you , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">Bush</label> told <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">a crowd of more than 1,000 people at a convention center in Green Bay , Wis.</label> `` <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">I</label> hope <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">you</label> redouble <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">your</label> efforts to make sure <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E32">people</label> get out to <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E33">the polls</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Minutes later , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">he</label> added : `` When <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">you</label> go out there and tell <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E34">the folks</label> where <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E35">we</label> stand on the issues and where <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E35">we</label> stand when it comes to bringing <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E36">people</label> together to get things done , and <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E29">you</label> tell them that the core of this campaign is the inherent trust in <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E5">the American people</label> , <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">I</label> believe it does n0027t matter <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E39">what political party</label> <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E37">they</label> 0027re in . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E23">The Texas governor</label> claimed that <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E49">Gore</label> 0027s decades of experience in <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E5">Washington</label> had estranged <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E49">him</label> from <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E40">the rest of the country</label> by making <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E49">him</label> too trusting of <label class="NYT20001106.1705.0187-E5">federal government</label> and too fond of federal spending . </p>
