<p>MARKET PLACE : TIME WARNER HOLDERS LOOK FOR HAPPY DAYS AFTER THE AOL </p>
<p>MERGER & QL ; By ALEX BERENSON & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; & UR ; & LR ; Back in January , when Internet stocks were hot , America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock . </p>
<p>The deal , if approved by regulators , would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company , even though Time Warner 's revenue and cash flow are far greater . </p>
<p>Since then , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[0]</b>AOL</label> 's stock has fallen by almost a third , destroying most of the premium <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[1]</b>the company</label> had offered for control of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[2]</b>Time Warner</label> . </p>
<p>So <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E55"><b>[4]</b>a Time Warner shareholder</label> might conclude that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57"><b>[6]</b>America Online 's chairman</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57"><b>[7]</b>Stephen Case</label> , had bamboozled <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59"><b>[10]</b>his Time Warner counterpart</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59"><b>[11]</b>Gerald Levin</label> , into taking <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[12]</b>AOL</label> 's shares at the worst possible time . </p>
<p>`` Short term , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E61"><b>[13]</b>anyone objective</label> would say probably <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57"><b>[14]</b>Steve</label> got the better part of the deal , '' said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[15]</b>Larry Haverty</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[16]</b>a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[20]</b>a longtime media investor</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[21]</b>Haverty , like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts</label> , hardly cares . </p>
<p>With the merger likely to be completed later this month , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[25]</b>he</label> predicts that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[26]</b>the merged company</label> will grow quickly by combining <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[27]</b>AOL</label> 's marketing skills and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E9"><b>[28]</b>captive base of online users</label> with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[30]</b>Time Warner</label> 's huge library of films , magazines and the like and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[31]</b>its</label> relationships with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E11"><b>[32]</b>major advertisers</label> . </p>
<p>`` The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E12"><b>[33]</b>the world</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1"><b>[34]</b>Haverty</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Five years out , if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13"><b>[35]</b>you</label> 're <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13"><b>[36]</b>a shareholder in this company</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13"><b>[38]</b>you</label> 're going to be <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13"><b>[39]</b>a happy camper</label> . </p>
<p>'' That view is widely shared . </p>
<p>`` Strategically , it makes a lot of sense , '' said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E16"><b>[40]</b>Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[42]</b>These companies</label> fill the holes of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E19"><b>[43]</b>the other one</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[44]</b>They</label> 're <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[45]</b>subscription-advertising combo models</label> . </p>
<p>The reality is the pieces are very compatible . </p>
<p>'' To be sure , the recent history of big <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E4"><b>[46]</b>media</label> mergers is hardly comforting for <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E21"><b>[47]</b>shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22"><b>[50]</b>Disney</label> stumbled badly after <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22"><b>[51]</b>it</label> bought <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E23"><b>[52]</b>Capital Cities/ABC</label> in 1996 , and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[53]</b>Time Warner</label> stagnated for five years after <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[54]</b>it</label> was created in 1990 by the merger of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E25"><b>[55]</b>Time</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E26"><b>[56]</b>Warner</label> . </p>
<p>`` Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty , '' said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E27"><b>[57]</b>Roger McNamee of Integral Capital , which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced</label> . </p>
<p>But if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[62]</b>the merged company</label> can overcome that hurdle , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[63]</b>it</label> will have big advantages over <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22"><b>[64]</b>Disney</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E30"><b>[65]</b>other traditional media companies , which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet</label> , said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E31"><b>[68]</b>Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch</label> . </p>
<p>`` Given the multiple distribution platforms that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[70]</b>they</label> have , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[71]</b>it</label> 's obviously <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[73]</b>a very powerful consumer engine</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E31"><b>[74]</b>Reif</label> said . </p>
<p>`` There 's a reason that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E35"><b>[75]</b>you</label> see <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22"><b>[76]</b>Disney</label> and to a lesser extent <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E36"><b>[77]</b>NBC</label> screaming in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E37"><b>[78]</b>Washington</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[79]</b>John Schreiber</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[80]</b>an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital , the mutual fund company that is Time Warner 's largest shareholder , with more than 120 million shares</label> , said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[86]</b>the companies</label> had already begun to demonstrate how <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[87]</b>they</label> would work together . </p>
<p>For example , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[88]</b>AOL</label> has pitched <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54"><b>[89]</b>Time Warner</label> 's magazines to <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E43"><b>[91]</b>its users</label> , resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[92]</b>the companies</label> are trying to sell <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E44"><b>[93]</b>big advertisers</label> on deals that will reach both <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E43"><b>[95]</b>America Online users</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E45"><b>[96]</b>the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[100]</b>Schreiber</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Once the merger closes , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[101]</b>I</label> think <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E46"><b>[102]</b>you</label> 'll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E47"><b>[103]</b>all of Time Warner 's advertisers</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[106]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[107]</b>Schreiber</label> also says the risk of cultural clashes between <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[108]</b>the companies</label> is limited , because <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18"><b>[109]</b>the companies</label> disclosed publicly where <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E48"><b>[110]</b>top executives</label> would stand in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[111]</b>the combined company</label> only a few weeks after the merger was announced . </p>
<p>So <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E49"><b>[112]</b>people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished</label> have had months to look for new jobs , and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E50"><b>[115]</b>some</label> have already left , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[116]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p>Given the strength <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[117]</b>he</label> sees in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8"><b>[118]</b>the combined company</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[119]</b>Schreiber</label> said the question of whether <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59"><b>[120]</b>Levin</label> could have negotiated a better deal with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24"><b>[121]</b>America Online</label> is moot . </p>
<p>Shares in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E51"><b>[122]</b>cable companies like Comcast</label> have fallen 15 percent or more this year , while <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E53"><b>[124]</b>big media companies</label> have been flat or up slightly . </p>
<p>So `` it 's not as if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E55"><b>[126]</b>Time Warner shareholders</label> have lost out on a great deal of upside , '' <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38"><b>[127]</b>Schreiber</label> said . </p>
