<p>MARKET PLACE : TIME WARNER HOLDERS LOOK FOR HAPPY DAYS AFTER THE AOL </p>
<p>MERGER 0026 QL ; By ALEX BERENSON 0026 QC ; 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; 0026 UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service 0026 QC ; 0026 LR ; 0026 QL ; 0026 UR ; 0026 LR ; Back in January , when Internet stocks were hot , America Online agreed to buy Time Warner with AOL stock . </p>
<p>The deal , if approved by regulators , would leave AOL shareholders with 55 percent of the merged company , even though Time Warner 0027s revenue and cash flow are far greater . </p>
<p>Since then , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">AOL</label> 0027s stock has fallen by almost a third , destroying most of the premium <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">the company</label> had offered for control of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">Time Warner</label> . </p>
<p>So <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E55">a Time Warner shareholder</label> might conclude that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57">America Online 0027s chairman</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57">Stephen Case</label> , had bamboozled <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59">his Time Warner counterpart</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59">Gerald Levin</label> , into taking <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">AOL</label> 0027s shares at the worst possible time . </p>
<p>`` Short term , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E61">anyone objective</label> would say probably <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E57">Steve</label> got the better part of the deal , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">Larry Haverty</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">a senior vice president at State Street Research in Boston</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">a longtime media investor</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">Haverty , like many other Time Warner shareholders and industry analysts</label> , hardly cares . </p>
<p>With the merger likely to be completed later this month , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">he</label> predicts that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">the merged company</label> will grow quickly by combining <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">AOL</label> 0027s marketing skills and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E9">captive base of online users</label> with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">Time Warner</label> 0027s huge library of films , magazines and the like and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">its</label> relationships with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E11">major advertisers</label> . </p>
<p>`` The deal strategically and financially makes all the sense in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E12">the world</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E1">Haverty</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Five years out , if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13">you</label> 0027re <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13">a shareholder in this company</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13">you</label> 0027re going to be <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E13">a happy camper</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 That view is widely shared . </p>
<p>`` Strategically , it makes a lot of sense , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E16">Tom Wolzien of Sanford C. Bernstein</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">These companies</label> fill the holes of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E19">the other one</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">They</label> 0027re <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">subscription-advertising combo models</label> . </p>
<p>The reality is the pieces are very compatible . </p>
<p>00270027 To be sure , the recent history of big <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E4">media</label> mergers is hardly comforting for <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E21">shareholders in either AOL or Time Warner</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22">Disney</label> stumbled badly after <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22">it</label> bought <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E23">Capital Cities/ABC</label> in 1996 , and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">Time Warner</label> stagnated for five years after <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">it</label> was created in 1990 by the merger of <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E25">Time</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E26">Warner</label> . </p>
<p>`` Huge deals are really hard to do and create a lot of uncertainty , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E27">Roger McNamee of Integral Capital , which sold its 404,000 AOL shares the day the merger was announced</label> . </p>
<p>But if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">the merged company</label> can overcome that hurdle , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">it</label> will have big advantages over <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22">Disney</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E30">other traditional media companies , which are still struggling to figure out how they can profit from the Internet</label> , said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E31">Jessica Reif of Merrill Lynch</label> . </p>
<p>`` Given the multiple distribution platforms that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">they</label> have , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">it</label> 0027s obviously <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">a very powerful consumer engine</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E31">Reif</label> said . </p>
<p>`` There 0027s a reason that <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E35">you</label> see <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E22">Disney</label> and to a lesser extent <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E36">NBC</label> screaming in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E37">Washington</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">John Schreiber</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">an assistant portfolio manager at Janus Capital , the mutual fund company that is Time Warner 0027s largest shareholder , with more than 120 million shares</label> , said <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">the companies</label> had already begun to demonstrate how <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">they</label> would work together . </p>
<p>For example , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">AOL</label> has pitched <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E54">Time Warner</label> 0027s magazines to <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E43">its users</label> , resulting in hundreds of thousands of new subscriptions . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">the companies</label> are trying to sell <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E44">big advertisers</label> on deals that will reach both <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E43">America Online users</label> and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E45">the people who watch Time Warner cable channels and read its magazines</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">Schreiber</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Once the merger closes , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">I</label> think <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E46">you</label> 0027ll see some very powerful cross-promotional deals across <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E47">all of Time Warner 0027s advertisers</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">he</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">Schreiber</label> also says the risk of cultural clashes between <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">the companies</label> is limited , because <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E18">the companies</label> disclosed publicly where <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E48">top executives</label> would stand in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">the combined company</label> only a few weeks after the merger was announced . </p>
<p>So <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E49">people who feel their responsibilities have been diminished</label> have had months to look for new jobs , and <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E50">some</label> have already left , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">he</label> said . </p>
<p>Given the strength <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">he</label> sees in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E8">the combined company</label> , <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">Schreiber</label> said the question of whether <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E59">Levin</label> could have negotiated a better deal with <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E24">America Online</label> is moot . </p>
<p>Shares in <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E51">cable companies like Comcast</label> have fallen 15 percent or more this year , while <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E53">big media companies</label> have been flat or up slightly . </p>
<p>So `` it 0027s not as if <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E55">Time Warner shareholders</label> have lost out on a great deal of upside , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001101.2212.0429-E38">Schreiber</label> said . </p>
