<p>Very bad things are in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2">our</label> future . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">You</label> should not be smiling . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E10">we</label> , the misled , should feel shame for what <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E10">we</label> 0027ve done . </p>
<p>00270027 The remarks expressed fears that votes for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> may have put <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Gov. George W. Bush</label> in a position to defeat <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Vice President Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15">Florida , where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes</label> Thursday , a shift of just a fraction of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> 0027s 95,000 votes could have given <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15">the state</label> , and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E8">the White House</label> , to <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Gore , the most likely major-party alternative for Nader 0027s supporters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18">John Ruth</label> , for example , wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18">he</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> because <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18">he</label> thought <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E19">they</label> `` shared a common goal 00270027 but that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18">he</label> was now regretting it . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Gore</label> ( despite what <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">you</label> have said ) is NOT <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">an environmental clone of G.W. Bush</label> . </p>
<p>Because of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">your</label> actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E21">we</label> are on the brink of a <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Bush</label> presidency . </p>
<p>No money , no support , no respect for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">you</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Ralph</label> , ever again ! </p>
<p>00270027 And in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E23">Oregon</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E23">a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E25">some Nader voters</label> to feel morning-after qualms . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">Julie Quastler , 28 , who voted for Nader in Portland</label> , said on Wednesday that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">she</label> was feeling `` a little alarmed and disappointed 00270027 that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Bush</label> seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">she</label> did not accept <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> 0027s assertion that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E30">the two parties</label> were equally bad . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">I</label> 0027m just so sad , 00270027 she said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Bush</label> is probably going to be <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">our president</label> and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> did n0027t get <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">his</label> 5 percent . </p>
<p>It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways . </p>
<p>00270027 Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2">the Green Party</label> for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004 . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">Quastler</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">the development director for a nonprofit cafe</label> , said <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">she</label> did not feel guilty about <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">her</label> vote . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">I</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> because <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">he</label> was most aligned with <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">my</label> values , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26">she</label> said . </p>
<p>Of course , there were also countless verbal high-fives among <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E32">Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties</label> . </p>
<p>`` Stand tall and proud , fellow <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> supporters , 00270027 said one message on the Nader2000 site signed GO LOOK ELSEWHERE FOR SCAPEGOATS . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E33">We</label> fought the good fight for what <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E33">we</label> believed in . </p>
<p>This does not make <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E33">us</label> <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E34">villains</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Such sentiments seemed particularly strong in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15">Florida</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">Dorothy Byrne</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">a state coordinator for the Florida Green Party</label> , said <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">she</label> had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E39">Democrats</label> , but has yet to receive one regretful note from <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E40">a Nader voter</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">I</label> can see positives for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2">the Greens</label> with either <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Bush</label> or <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Gore</label> being <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E41">president</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">she</label> said . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Gore</label> was in , we would n0027t have to worry about <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E42">women</label> 0027s reproductive rights . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">his</label> record on the environment is so abysmal <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E35">I</label> do n0027t see how <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11">Bush</label> can be any worse . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">Barbara Lange</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">the Everglades chairwoman for the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club</label> , said <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">she</label> and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E49">other environmentalists</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> because <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13">Gore</label> had not taken a stand against the development of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E50">a commercial airport near the Everglades</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">I</label> voted <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">my</label> conscience , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">she</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E43">I</label> 0027m okay with that . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E52">Patricia Newell</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E52">an organizer for Nader at the University of Florida in Gainesville</label> , said that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6">Nader</label> had won far fewer votes in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15">Florida</label> than <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E56">his supporters</label> had expected _ due , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E52">she</label> said , to `` scare tactics 00270027 by <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E57">the Democrats</label> . </p>
