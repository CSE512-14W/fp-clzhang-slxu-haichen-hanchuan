<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E9"><b>[0]</b>WASHINGTON</label> _ <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[1]</b>Ralph Nader</label> may not be feeling any regrets about <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[2]</b>his</label> <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2"><b>[3]</b>Green Party</label> <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E61"><b>[4]</b>presidential</label> campaign , but <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E62"><b>[5]</b>some visitors to the chat room on Nader2000 .</label> </p>
<p>org , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[6]</b>Nader</label> 's official campaign website , sounded as if a bad hangover had come crashing down on <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E62"><b>[7]</b>them</label> . </p>
<p>There was this entry , for instance , posted Thursday morning by <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[8]</b>a writer named `` wreckz</label> '' : `` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[10]</b>I</label> , too , feel <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[11]</b>I</label> should apologize to <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E64"><b>[12]</b>America</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[13]</b>I</label> was duped . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[14]</b>Ralph Nader</label> 's enjoyment of all of this is an indication of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[15]</b>a man more concerned with vindictive politics than the future of our country and planet</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[18]</b>I</label> am no longer <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E1"><b>[19]</b>a member of the Green Party</label> . </p>
<p>Instead , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[21]</b>I</label> 'm <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E3"><b>[22]</b>a member of the green movement _ a movement without Ralph Nader</label> . </p>
<p>'' Or this one , also posted Thursday morning , from `` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[26]</b>Noni</label> '' : `` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[27]</b>I</label> saw an interview with <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[28]</b>Ralph Nader</label> today and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[29]</b>he</label> seemed to be enjoying what has happened ! </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[30]</b>I</label> 've never seen <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[31]</b>him</label> smile so broadly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[32]</b>I</label> regret <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[33]</b>my</label> support . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[34]</b>Nader</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[35]</b>you</label> 're <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[36]</b>a well-intending man</label> and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E5"><b>[37]</b>I</label> agree with most of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[38]</b>your</label> positions . </p>
<p>But the symbolic run for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E8"><b>[39]</b>the White House</label> has destroyed <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2"><b>[41]</b>our Party</label> and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2"><b>[42]</b>our</label> cause . </p>
<p>Very bad things are in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2"><b>[43]</b>our</label> future . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[44]</b>You</label> should not be smiling . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E10"><b>[45]</b>we</label> , the misled , should feel shame for what <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E10"><b>[46]</b>we</label> 've done . </p>
<p>'' The remarks expressed fears that votes for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[47]</b>Nader</label> may have put <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11"><b>[49]</b>Gov. George W. Bush</label> in a position to defeat <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13"><b>[51]</b>Vice President Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15"><b>[52]</b>Florida , where Gore trailed Bush by only a few hundred votes</label> Thursday , a shift of just a fraction of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[56]</b>Nader</label> 's 95,000 votes could have given <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E15"><b>[57]</b>the state</label> , and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E8"><b>[58]</b>the White House</label> , to <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13"><b>[59]</b>Gore , the most likely major-party alternative for Nader 's supporters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18"><b>[63]</b>John Ruth</label> , for example , wrote on the Nader2000 site Thursday morning that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18"><b>[64]</b>he</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[65]</b>Nader</label> because <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18"><b>[66]</b>he</label> thought <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E19"><b>[67]</b>they</label> `` shared a common goal '' but that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E18"><b>[68]</b>he</label> was now regretting it . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13"><b>[69]</b>Gore</label> ( despite what <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[70]</b>you</label> have said ) is NOT <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E13"><b>[71]</b>an environmental clone of G.W. Bush</label> . </p>
<p>Because of <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[73]</b>your</label> actions and statements prior to Nov. 7th , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E21"><b>[74]</b>we</label> are on the brink of a <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11"><b>[75]</b>Bush</label> presidency . </p>
<p>No money , no support , no respect for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[76]</b>you</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[77]</b>Ralph</label> , ever again ! </p>
<p>'' And in <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E23"><b>[78]</b>Oregon</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E23"><b>[79]</b>a state that was still too close to call Thursday afternoon</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[80]</b>Nader</label> won about 5 percent of the vote _ enough to cause <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E25"><b>[82]</b>some Nader voters</label> to feel morning-after qualms . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[83]</b>Julie Quastler , 28 , who voted for Nader in Portland</label> , said on Wednesday that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[87]</b>she</label> was feeling `` a little alarmed and disappointed '' that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11"><b>[88]</b>Bush</label> seemed on the brink of winning the presidency _ suggesting that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[89]</b>she</label> did not accept <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[90]</b>Nader</label> 's assertion that <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E30"><b>[91]</b>the two parties</label> were equally bad . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[92]</b>I</label> 'm just so sad , '' she said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11"><b>[93]</b>Bush</label> is probably going to be <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E11"><b>[95]</b>our president</label> and <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[96]</b>Nader</label> did n't get <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[97]</b>his</label> 5 percent . </p>
<p>It seems like a lose-lose end result in some ways . </p>
<p>'' Winning 5 percent of the vote nationwide would have qualified <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E2"><b>[98]</b>the Green Party</label> for millions of dollars in federal campaign funds in 2004 . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[99]</b>Quastler</label> , <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[100]</b>the development director for a nonprofit cafe</label> , said <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[102]</b>she</label> did not feel guilty about <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[103]</b>her</label> vote . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[104]</b>I</label> voted for <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[105]</b>Nader</label> because <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E6"><b>[106]</b>he</label> was most aligned with <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[107]</b>my</label> values , '' <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E26"><b>[108]</b>she</label> said . </p>
<p>Of course , there were also countless verbal high-fives among <label class="NYT20001109.1946.0315-E32"><b>[110]</b>Nader supporters Thursday who felt the Green Party had sent a bracing wake-up call to the two major parties</label> . </p>
