<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E19">TALLAHASSEE , Fla.</label> _ After throwing barbs at <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E42">all the other presidential candidates</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E43">Scott Dailey</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E43">a member of the school board here</label> , introduced <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Pat Buchanan</label> to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E47">a luncheon audience</label> Thursday by joshing : `` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Pat</label> says <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> is <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">a serious candidate</label> . </p>
<p>The polls say <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> is dead serious . </p>
<p>00270027 It is an assessment that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">the Reform Party candidate</label> , does not strenuously dispute . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E40">many in political circles</label> believe that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E50">Ralph Nader</label> could affect the outcome of the election next week by draining votes away from <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E1">Vice President Al Gore</label> in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E4">crucial states</label> , possibly even <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E41">Florida</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E5">hardly anyone , least of all Buchanan</label> , believes the <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> candidacy will be decisive . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">He</label> does not have much support in the first place , as <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E43">Dailey</label> 0027s introduction implied . </p>
<p>And the support <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> does have , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> feels , is as likely to be drawn from <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E1">Gore</label> as from <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E6">Bush</label> . </p>
<p>A <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E7">New York Times/CBS</label> News poll taken statewide last week showed <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> with 1 percent of the vote in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E41">Florida</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">He</label> is apparently not doing much better <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E9">anywhere else in the country</label> . </p>
<p>At a news conference <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E19">here</label> Thursday , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> said one problem <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> faced was <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">his</label> lack of support from <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E11">conservative Republicans</label> . </p>
<p>`` The great driving factor of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E12">conservatives</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> said , `` is to get rid of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E1">Al Gore</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E13">Many of those who will vote for him</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> said , would probably not bother to vote if <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> were not in the race . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E15">Others</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> said , are `` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E15">social conservative Republicans</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E17">Still others</label> are <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E17">blue-collar Democrats who like his protectionist trade policies because they fear their jobs could go overseas</label> . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E6">Bush</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E1">Gore</label> are in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E41">Florida</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E20">they</label> talk about Social Security , Medicare , taxes and education . </p>
<p>In speeches like the one <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> gave Thursday to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E21">the Tiger Bay Club downtown</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> talked about issues that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E23">the other candidates</label> skip : immigration , the culture war , school prayer and international trade . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> 0027s television advertisements in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E24">northern Florida</label> also deal with issues that are not being addressed by <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E23">others</label> : English as an official language and the right of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E25">the Boy Scouts</label> to exclude <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E26">gays</label> . </p>
<p>A new advertisement depicts <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E1">Gore</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E6">Bush</label> as selling out to special interests . </p>
<p>Why is <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> running when <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> knows <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> has no chance to win or even affect the outcome ? </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E27">We</label> want to build <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E28">a new third party</label> _ <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E28">a conservative party</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">Buchanan</label> said . </p>
<p>One main goal , almost certainly out of reach , is to get 5 percent of the vote nationally so that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E30">the Reform Party</label> can get federal matching funds in the next presidential election . </p>
<p>Here is how <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> described this year 0027s presidential race : `` When <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E32">Goldwater</label> versus <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E33">Johnson</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had clarity . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E34">Nixon</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E35">Agnew</label> versus <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E36">McGovern</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had clarity . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E37">Reagan</label> versus <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E38">Mondale</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E31">you</label> had clarity . </p>
<p>00270027 This year , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E46">he</label> said , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0340-E20">the major-party candidates</label> campaign with a `` conscious vagueness . </p>
