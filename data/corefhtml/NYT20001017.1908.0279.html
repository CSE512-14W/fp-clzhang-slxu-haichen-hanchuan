<p>JUDGE RULES AGAINST COMPANY IN TAX SCHEME CASE </p>
<p>& UR ; By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[0]</b>A federal judge in Delaware</label> , in a decision made public on Tuesday , held that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[2]</b>one company</label> 's corporate tax shelter was a sham and noted that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E25"><b>[3]</b>85 other large corporations</label> used the same deduction to avoid paying $ 6 billion in corporate income taxes . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[7]</b>U.S. District Court Judge Murray Schwartz in Wilmington , Del.</label> , ruled that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[10]</b>Camelot Music</label> could not deduct interest on loans <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[11]</b>it</label> took out against life insurance on <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E30"><b>[13]</b>its 1,430 employees</label> in 1990 through 1993 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[14]</b>Camelot Music</label> is owned by <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E31"><b>[15]</b>Trans World Entertainment , which bought the company last year for $ 451.9 million</label> . </p>
<p>The decision could affect <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E32"><b>[18]</b>many of the other 85 companies , which the judge did not identify by name</label> , because <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[22]</b>his</label> ruling applies to <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E1"><b>[23]</b>every company organized in Delaware , whose corporate-governance laws have made it a major center for large companies to have their nominal headquarters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5"><b>[31]</b>American Electric Power</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5"><b>[32]</b>an electric utility in Columbus , Ohio</label> , has a case involving almost identical issues scheduled to go to trial in two weeks . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E9"><b>[35]</b>Pat D. Hemlepp</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E9"><b>[36]</b>a spokesman for the company</label> , said that $ 240 million in taxes were at issue . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[38]</b>Camelot</label> took out life insurance from <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E11"><b>[39]</b>the Hartford Group</label> beginning in 1990 on <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E30"><b>[41]</b>its 1,430 workers</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[42]</b>The company</label> paid for the insurance , taking a deduction for this expense , and then borrowed back the premium through a loan against the insurance policy . </p>
<p>On <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[43]</b>its</label> corporate income tax returns <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[44]</b>the company</label> took $ 13.8 million of deductions in 1990 through 1993 tax returns for interest <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[45]</b>it</label> paid on the loans . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[46]</b>Schwartz</label> said that there was no build up in the cash value of the insurance policies and because of the way the loans were structured there was no reasonable prospect that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[47]</b>the company</label> would profit from buying the insurance . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[48]</b>He</label> called the arrangement `` a factual sham '' that `` lacked objective economic substance and a subjective business purpose other than the tax benefits flowing from the interest deductions . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17"><b>[49]</b>The judge</label> said the deal `` crossed the line '' on permissible deductions by such a wide margin that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E12"><b>[50]</b>the Internal Revenue Service</label> was right to impose penalties for filing in an inaccurate tax return . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13"><b>[51]</b>John Sullivan</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13"><b>[53]</b>Trans World Entertainment 's chief financial officer</label> , said that if the decision stood it would cost <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[54]</b>the company</label> about $ 8 million plus interest . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13"><b>[55]</b>I</label> 'm surprised by the ruling , '' <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13"><b>[56]</b>Sullivan</label> said , adding that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13"><b>[57]</b>he</label> expected <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[58]</b>the company</label> would appeal the decision . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15"><b>[59]</b>Camelot Music</label> and <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5"><b>[60]</b>American Electric Power</label> cases are similar to the corporate-owned life insurance policy tax shelter of <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E18"><b>[61]</b>Winn-Dixie Stores</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E18"><b>[63]</b>a big supermarket chain</label> , that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E21"><b>[65]</b>a tax court judge</label> demolished last year in an 81-page opinion . </p>
