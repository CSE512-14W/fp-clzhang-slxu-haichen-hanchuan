<p>& UR ; By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">A federal judge in Delaware</label> , in a decision made public on Tuesday , held that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">one company</label> 's corporate tax shelter was a sham and noted that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E25">85 other large corporations</label> used the same deduction to avoid paying $ 6 billion in corporate income taxes . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">U.S. District Court Judge Murray Schwartz in Wilmington , Del.</label> , ruled that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">Camelot Music</label> could not deduct interest on loans <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">it</label> took out against life insurance on <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E30">its 1,430 employees</label> in 1990 through 1993 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">Camelot Music</label> is owned by <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E31">Trans World Entertainment , which bought the company last year for $ 451.9 million</label> . </p>
<p>The decision could affect <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E32">many of the other 85 companies , which the judge did not identify by name</label> , because <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">his</label> ruling applies to <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E1">every company organized in Delaware , whose corporate-governance laws have made it a major center for large companies to have their nominal headquarters</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5">American Electric Power</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5">an electric utility in Columbus , Ohio</label> , has a case involving almost identical issues scheduled to go to trial in two weeks . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E9">Pat D. Hemlepp</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E9">a spokesman for the company</label> , said that $ 240 million in taxes were at issue . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">Camelot</label> took out life insurance from <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E11">the Hartford Group</label> beginning in 1990 on <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E30">its 1,430 workers</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">The company</label> paid for the insurance , taking a deduction for this expense , and then borrowed back the premium through a loan against the insurance policy . </p>
<p>On <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">its</label> corporate income tax returns <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">the company</label> took $ 13.8 million of deductions in 1990 through 1993 tax returns for interest <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">it</label> paid on the loans . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">Schwartz</label> said that there was no build up in the cash value of the insurance policies and because of the way the loans were structured there was no reasonable prospect that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">the company</label> would profit from buying the insurance . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">He</label> called the arrangement `` a factual sham '' that `` lacked objective economic substance and a subjective business purpose other than the tax benefits flowing from the interest deductions . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E17">The judge</label> said the deal `` crossed the line '' on permissible deductions by such a wide margin that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E12">the Internal Revenue Service</label> was right to impose penalties for filing in an inaccurate tax return . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13">John Sullivan</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13">Trans World Entertainment 's chief financial officer</label> , said that if the decision stood it would cost <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">the company</label> about $ 8 million plus interest . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13">I</label> 'm surprised by the ruling , '' <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13">Sullivan</label> said , adding that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E13">he</label> expected <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">the company</label> would appeal the decision . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E15">Camelot Music</label> and <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E5">American Electric Power</label> cases are similar to the corporate-owned life insurance policy tax shelter of <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E18">Winn-Dixie Stores</label> , <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E18">a big supermarket chain</label> , that <label class="NYT20001017.1908.0279-E21">a tax court judge</label> demolished last year in an 81-page opinion . </p>
