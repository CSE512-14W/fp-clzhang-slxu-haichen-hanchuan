<p><label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E27"><b>[0]</b>BOSTON</label> _ <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E47"><b>[2]</b>Michael McNamara 's ambulance</label> took the call : <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E49"><b>[3]</b>an 89-year-old woman with cancer , abdominal pain , possibly a broken hip after a fall</label> . </p>
<p>Normally , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E48"><b>[4]</b>McNamara , an emergency medical technician</label> , would have taken her to <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E1"><b>[6]</b>Massachusetts General Hospital</label> , to <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E52"><b>[7]</b>the doctors who care for her</label> . </p>
<p>But , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E48"><b>[10]</b>he</label> had to tell <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E49"><b>[11]</b>her</label> , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E1"><b>[12]</b>the hospital</label> was turning down <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E9"><b>[13]</b>ambulances</label> at the moment . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E48"><b>[14]</b>He</label> had told <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E54"><b>[15]</b>several other patients</label> the same thing that afternoon , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E48"><b>[16]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p>And similar things on many other days as well . </p>
<p>This year , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E1"><b>[17]</b>Massachusetts General , considered one of the country 's best hospitals</label> , has been `` on diversion '' for about 45 hours every week ; and on average , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E4"><b>[21]</b>two of the city 's emergency rooms</label> close to <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E9"><b>[24]</b>ambulances</label> at some point every day . </p>
<p>For years it was all but unheard of in <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E6"><b>[25]</b>most cities</label> for <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E7"><b>[26]</b>a hospital</label> to regularly hang out a `` No Vacancy '' sign for <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E8"><b>[28]</b>ambulance crews</label> . </p>
<p>But in recent months , in <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E10"><b>[29]</b>cities from Boston to San Francisco , Phoenix to Denver</label> , it has become common , to the alarm of <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E14"><b>[34]</b>doctors , paramedics and patients</label> . </p>
<p>Now <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E15"><b>[35]</b>some</label> are worrying openly that <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E16"><b>[36]</b>patient</label> care is suffering because of the extra minutes spent in <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E9"><b>[37]</b>ambulances</label> and because of the <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E17"><b>[38]</b>emergency-room</label> crowding that causes the diversions in the first place . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E18"><b>[39]</b>Virtually every major metropolitan area</label> , and <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E19"><b>[40]</b>many rural areas</label> , are struggling with this issue , '' said <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E20"><b>[42]</b>Dr. Arthur Kellermann , chairman of emergency medicine at Emory University School of Medicine</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E23"><b>[45]</b>They</label> 're seeing <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E24"><b>[46]</b>eight or 10 or 12 hospitals</label> in <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E25"><b>[47]</b>a major urban market</label> simultaneously on EMS diversion because , say , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E24"><b>[48]</b>they</label> have no <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E26"><b>[49]</b>inpatient</label> beds or critical care beds . </p>
<p>'' The problem , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E20"><b>[50]</b>Kellermann</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E28"><b>[51]</b>other emergency doctors</label> said , is not only the crowding of <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E17"><b>[52]</b>the emergency rooms themselves</label> ; it is also the crowding of acute-care hospital beds in general . </p>
<p>A survey this year of <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E30"><b>[55]</b>more than 60 emergency department directors</label> by <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E32"><b>[56]</b>the Massachusetts College of Emergency Physicians</label> found that <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E33"><b>[57]</b>more than 80 percent of them</label> had been forced to divert <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E9"><b>[59]</b>ambulances</label> and <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E34"><b>[60]</b>about 38 percent</label> said <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E34"><b>[61]</b>they</label> had seen `` adverse outcomes '' as a result of crowding . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E35"><b>[62]</b>some</label> remain cautious about declaring a crisis , among <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E35"><b>[63]</b>them</label> <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E36"><b>[65]</b>Dr. Dennis S. O 'Leary , president of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations , an agency that certifies hospital quality , who has said the system would `` muddle through '' the problem</label> . </p>
<p>In a telephone interview , <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E36"><b>[72]</b>O 'Leary</label> said that it still needed to be scientifically proved that the increased diversions were a trend and not the kind of sporadic surges that have mysteriously appeared and disappeared before . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E42"><b>[74]</b>Dr. Alan Woodward , chief of emergency services at Emerson Hospital in Concord</label> , begged to differ . </p>
<p>`` Muddling costs <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E46"><b>[78]</b>lives</label> , '' he said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E42"><b>[79]</b>He</label> said <label class="NYT20001216.1450.0120-E36"><b>[80]</b>O 'Leary</label> `` is unaware of the problem and the magnitude to which it 's grown . </p>
