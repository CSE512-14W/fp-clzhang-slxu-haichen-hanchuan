<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[0]</b>Compaq Computer</label> reported earnings and sales that beat <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E35"><b>[1]</b>Wall Street</label> 's expectations Tuesday , bolstering arguments that <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[2]</b>the company</label> is rebounding from problems that had hurt <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[3]</b>its</label> performance the last two years . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[4]</b>Compaq</label> said <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[5]</b>it</label> netted $ 550 million , or 31 cents a diluted share , in the quarter ended Sept. 30 , a leap of 23 cents a share , or 288 percent , from the similar period in 1999 . </p>
<p>About $ 25 million , or a penny a share , came from investment income rather than operations , but after discounting that boost , <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[6]</b>Compaq</label> still beat the average of <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E1"><b>[7]</b>analysts</label> ' projections by a penny a share . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[8]</b>Compaq , which is based in Houston</label> , reported worldwide revenue of $ 11.2 billion for the quarter , an increase of 22 percent over the previous year 's period . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[9]</b>Compaq</label> said that revenues would have grown 26 percent but for the strength of the dollar , which reduced the value of <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E3"><b>[10]</b>overseas</label> sales compared with a year ago . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[11]</b>Our</label> results clearly demonstrate <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[12]</b>our</label> tremendous momentum in the marketplace , '' said <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[13]</b>Michael Capellas</label> , <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[14]</b>chairman</label> and <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[15]</b>chief executive</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[16]</b>We</label> 're on a bit of a roll . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[17]</b>Capellas</label> noted that the strong growth had come from <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E7"><b>[18]</b>every region of the world</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[19]</b>He</label> also expressed confidence that <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[20]</b>Compaq</label> would meet <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[21]</b>its</label> previous projections of 18 percent revenue growth in the current quarter and 40 percent earnings growth in 2001 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E9"><b>[22]</b>Analysts</label> were pleased , if not completely persuaded , by the positive report . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[23]</b>Compaq</label> reported strong overall growth in <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E10"><b>[24]</b>its server business</label> , several observers noted that the 5 percent growth in <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E11"><b>[25]</b>the Unix server segment</label> was well below the <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E12"><b>[26]</b>industry</label> average . </p>
<p>Similarly , the 9 percent growth in <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E13"><b>[27]</b>the data storage business</label> was an improvement on past quarters , but below the growth rate of <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E14"><b>[28]</b>competitors , like EMC</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[29]</b>Compaq</label> is <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[30]</b>the world 's leading maker of personal computers</label> , and <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E17"><b>[31]</b>its PC business</label> was stronger than <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E18"><b>[32]</b>many analysts</label> had projected . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E19"><b>[33]</b>The commercial PC unit</label> had revenues of $ 3.5 billion , up 28 percent from a year ago , and <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E19"><b>[34]</b>its</label> operating income was $ 133 million , compared with a loss of $ 169 million a year ago . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E20"><b>[35]</b>The consumer PC unit</label> had revenue of $ 2.1 billion , an increase of 45 percent over the year-ago period , although a softening market and pricing pressures cut operating income 3 percent to $ 63 million . </p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest continuing weakness was in <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E21"><b>[36]</b>Compaq 's services business</label> . </p>
<p>Revenues attributed to <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E22"><b>[37]</b>Compaq 's 40,000 consultants</label> fell 2 percent , to $ 1.7 billion , and operating income dropped 16 percent , to $ 254 million . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E4"><b>[38]</b>Capellas</label> said that improving <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E21"><b>[39]</b>that group</label> 's performance was a high priority . </p>
<p>Over all , though , <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E23"><b>[40]</b>Compaq enthusiasts like Kurtis R. King , an analyst at Banc of America Securities who rates the company a `` strong buy</label> , '' said the quarter validated <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[41]</b>their</label> bullishness . </p>
<p>And even <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E28"><b>[42]</b>skeptics who were not advising clients to buy the stock , like Charles R. Wolf at UBS Warburg</label> , called the quarter a good one . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[43]</b>They</label> 're turning , but the turn is n't completed yet , '' <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E30"><b>[44]</b>Wolf</label> said . </p>
<p>The results were released after the end of trading on <label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E32"><b>[45]</b>the New York Stock Exchange</label> Tuesday . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001024.2203.0349-E16"><b>[46]</b>Compaq</label> 's shares closed up 70 cents , to $ 28.40 , on the Big Board . </p>
