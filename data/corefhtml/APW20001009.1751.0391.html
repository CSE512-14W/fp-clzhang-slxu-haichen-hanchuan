<p>Rabanne Fashion Has Silver Lining </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E8">PARIS</label> <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E9">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">Paco Rabanne</label> 's Monday show of ready-to-wear for summer 2001 was shiny , young and happy . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">He</label> decided that fashion has a silver lining _ and exterior , as well . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">The designer</label> was expected to retire a couple of seasons ago , but <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">he</label> only gave up haute couture , and threw <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">his</label> well-known talents for chain-mail and sequins into <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E11">boutique</label> clothes . </p>
<p>With a waterfall background , <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E12">the models</label> paraded by in gold or silver disc dresses , super slithery silver metallic bikinis , wraps and micro-mini dresses or hot pants . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">Well over sixty , Rabanne</label> still has an eye for the younger circuit . </p>
<p>The smooth caramel imitation leather outfits with nailheads _ jackets , flared pants and more _ were remarkable . </p>
<p>Also entertaining was the bikini in tortoise-shell-patterned plastic discs . </p>
<p>Bare midriffs and trousers flared and split halfway up the leg looked zingy . </p>
<p>Of course , there were hot pants , in glitzy metallics and soft leather , and there were metal hip belts or breastplate neckwear galore . </p>
<p>Softwear here included geometrics on striped minis in little crepe or organza dresses , some good trouser outfits with plastic or metal adorning halter-neck toppers . </p>
<p>For eye-popping specials , <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E10">Rabanne</label> came out with plenty of fluorescent green and orange , quite fun for <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E13">the disco</label> in a rhodoid disc-decorated minidress with matching bag . </p>
<p>The long silky and tulle black <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E5">ballerina</label> outfits were a sober note , though the sandals were interesting _ heels only , clinging to the foot , with a ring on a toe . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E14">Dries van Noten</label> also produced an amusing , appealing collection that stood as a feminine moment . </p>
<p>The flowered skirts in sun pleats , the interesting striped jackets in <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E15">Indian</label> silk , teamed with shiny black and white patent high-heeled pumps , looked partly retro , but eminently wearable . </p>
<p>Low-keyed glamour here included <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E6">flapper</label> looks in low-belted outfits with short pleated skirts , some super <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E7">sailor-style</label> trouser outfits with fluid ivory or white pants and little jackets and striped shirts . </p>
<p>Prints for the georgette crepes and chiffons were often wonderful . </p>
<p>They looked like watercolors of arbors or fantasy flowers . </p>
<p>Ruffles peeping out here and there from skirts or on tops added more feminine touches . </p>
<p>Dresses in hibiscus-embroidered fabrics , large chiffon shawls with floral embroideries , boxy silk jackets and the hipster pants all made for a fine offering . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E16">Gaspard Yurkievitch</label> , <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E16">a young French designer , showing in the Petit Palais</label> , could make the grade in <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E1">some stores</label> with <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E16">his</label> offhand styles that <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E3">some</label> find cool but that lacked sex appeal . </p>
<p>A black bathing suit with a fawn suede jacket with nailhead snaps was followed by skinny fawn trousers with plenty of bare midriff showing under the black bra . </p>
<p>Then things went into the puffy , baggy lines , the latest look-back-to-Eighties styles seen on some runways . </p>
<p>In cotton satins and other fabrics , <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E16">Yurkievitch</label> showed pants with baggy bottoms , skirts with bubbly effects and some odd ruffles around armholes . </p>
<p>These often came in colors like magenta or brown . </p>
<p>Even <label class="APW20001009.1751.0391-E4">harem</label> pants or a totally topless number with lacy black pants and bikini bottoms failed to lure . </p>
