<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E21">WASHINGTON</label> _ When <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E67">the leader of the Hezbollah in Syrian-occupied Lebanon</label> came up with a plan to kidnap <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E80">three Israeli soldiers</label> six weeks ago , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E82">his Iranian sponsors</label> cautioned <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E67">him</label> to first get the approval of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">Bashar Assad</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">the new president of Syria</label> . </p>
<p>That 0027s because <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E6">Israel</label> was expected to retaliate against <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E1">Hezbollah forces in areas controlled by Syrian troops</label> . </p>
<p>Ever since <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E5">Israel 0027s troops</label> pulled out of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E7">its Lebanese buffer zone</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E3">Hezbollah</label> 0027s terrorism has been closely coordinated with <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">Bashar</label> in <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E9">Damascus</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E10">Usually reliable intelligence sources</label> note that <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">the inexperienced Bashar</label> , eager to establish credentials in <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E11">the Arab world</label> as <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E35">a militant enemy of Israel</label> , gave <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">his</label> approval to the kidnap plan . </p>
<p>This despite the danger that the <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E3">Hezbollah</label> 0027s capture of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E13">Israeli soldiers</label> could lead to armed confrontation in <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E8">Lebanon</label> between <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E15">Syrian and Israeli forces</label> . </p>
<p>On or about Oct. 8 , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E16">Hassan Nasrallah</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E16">secretary general of Hezbollah</label> , reported directly to <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">Bashar</label> that the kidnapping had been carried out as planned . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">Bashar</label> was heard to have congratulated <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E16">him</label> on its `` smooth execution , 00270027 goes the undercover account , and assured <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E16">the terrorist leader</label> full backing against anticipated mild <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E18">U.N.</label> reaction as well as a stronger response from <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E6">Israel</label> . </p>
<p>The risk accepted by <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E19">Arab and Persian leaders</label> in a daring provocation within <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E7">what Israel considers its territory</label> was evidence of what is emerging as <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Yasser Arafat</label> 0027s strategy . </p>
<p>From <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">his</label> turnabout that so surprised <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E23">President Clinton</label> at the <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E25">Camp David</label> fiasco , to <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">his</label> reluctance to speak out to restrain the rioting of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E28">Palestinians</label> and sniping of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E27">his gunmen-police</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">his</label> plan can be deduced : First step is to transform the `` peace process , 00270027 which was in danger of succeeding in establishing <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E29">a small Palestinian state</label> , into a religious `` war process 00270027 for control of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E30">Jerusalem</label> and <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E31">a state incorporating Jordan and Israel</label> . </p>
<p>What keeps Arafat in power is not the dubious economic promise of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E26">a struggling dictatorship</label> but <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E36">his militant followers</label> 0027 dream of driving <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E37">the Jews</label> out of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E38">the Middle East</label> . </p>
<p>Second step is to whip up support in <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E39">world</label> opinion by creating <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E40">innocent victims of Israeli guns</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E42">Palestinian snipers</label> draw fire into <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E43">civilian crowds</label> for the sole purpose of sacrificing <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E45">innocents</label> , creating anguished funeral demonstrations and spreading hatred . </p>
<p>Every casualty is exploitable ; every picture of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E46">a boy with a slingshot rather than a gun</label> is a small victory ; the gut-wrenching film of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E49">the boy dying in a crossfire</label> was a propaganda triumph . </p>
<p>Though such a war process does not win <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E50">military</label> victory , it delivers results : In a much less well-armed form of intifada a few years ago , it led to Oslo and ultimately to <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">Ehud Barak</label> 0027s stunning concessions . </p>
<p>But to attain a goal of stimulating the defeat of <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E6">Israel</label> by <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E52">Arab armies far stronger than his own</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Arafat</label> needs more than sustained low-level belligerency that wears down the Israeli will ; <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">he</label> needs to provoke a new <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E38">Middle East</label> war . </p>
<p>That explains the campaign to sacrifice <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E55">Palestinian women and children</label> , opening the possibility for <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E56">a stray Israeli shell</label> to inflict horrific tragedy . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E58">Infuriated Muslims throughout the region</label> then put pressure on <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E57">shaky sheiks</label> to support another such war . </p>
<p>That 0027s why <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E59">we</label> see <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E60">Arafat 0027s allies in the Hezbollah</label> enticing <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E84">Syria 0027s strongman</label> into taking risks <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E61">his dictator-father</label> <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E61">Hafez</label> _ having learned a bloody lesson that cost <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E61">him</label> <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E73">the Golan</label> _ would have avoided . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Arafat</label> also knows that <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E63">Iraq 0027s Saddam Hussein</label> , developing <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E66">weaponry to counter Israel 0027s nuclear deterrent</label> , is spoiling to send <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E65">his tanks and Scuds</label> through <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E33">Jordan</label> into <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E6">his enemy 0027s homeland</label> . </p>
<p>The possibility of such a <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E26">Palestinian-sparked</label> conflagration must be foremost in <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">Barak</label> 0027s mind as <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">he</label> deals with the rioting and kidnapping . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">He</label> must respond with seeming toughness , lest <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E6">Israelis</label> scorn <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">him</label> for being weak ; yet <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">he</label> must not use too much firepower , lest he fall into <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Arafat</label> 0027s wider-war trap . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">Barak</label> 0027s demonstrated dovishness may force <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E51">him</label> to err on the side of using ever-greater force and thereby be drawn into <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Arafat</label> 0027s war process . </p>
<p>The paradox is that <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E68">the Israeli opposition leader</label> <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E68">Arik Sharon</label> 0027s longtime reputation for fierceness would enable <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E68">the Likud leader</label> to enforce separation , control <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E50">military</label> escalation and stop that war process . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E70">America</label> 0027s mind is fixed on <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E70">its</label> own affairs , but thanks to <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E22">Arafat</label> , <label class="NYT20001119.2132.0191-E71">whoever wins the White House</label> is sure to have a stressful first 100 days . </p>
