<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E1">Arab states</label> and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E3">developing nations</label> asked for the emergency meeting Friday after <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">the Security Council</label> indicated <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">it</label> did not want another contentious session while diplomatic efforts were under way to end the violence that cost the lives of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E5">96 people , most Palestinians</label> . </p>
<p>With <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E6">a majority of the 189 U.N. member states</label> now supporting a special session on the current unrest , an emergency meeting is virtually certain . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E10">Spokeswoman Sue Markham</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E12">General Assembly President Harri Holkeri</label> will consult with <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E15">other member states</label> on the request and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E16">Arab diplomats</label> said a meeting is likely to be held early next week . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E17">The Palestinian representative</label> , <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E17">Nasser Al-Kidwa</label> , had originally requested an emergency meeting of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">the Security Council</label> to adopt a new resolution , saying <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E19">Israeli rocket</label> attacks on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E20">Palestinian command centers</label> Thursday _ retaliation for the brutal lynching of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E21">two Israeli soldiers</label> _ were `` tantamount to the declaration of an overall war against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E46">the entire Palestinian people</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 But <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E22">U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E24">the United States</label> would veto any new resolution and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E27">other council members</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E27">they</label> wanted to give <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28">Secretary-General Kofi Annan</label> time to negotiate a truce before taking any new action . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E51">The two sides</label> announced Saturday <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E51">they</label> would hold a summit in <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E30">Egypt</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">Security Council</label> resolutions have more clout because they are legally binding . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14">General Assembly</label> resolutions are adopted by majority vote and cannot be vetoed , but are not legally binding . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">Security Council</label> resolution last week condemned the `` excessive use of force 00270027 against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E46">the Palestinians</label> _ without naming <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43">Israel</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14">General Assembly</label> draft resolution would condemn `` the excessive use of force by <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E44">the Israeli occupying forces</label> against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E32">Palestinian civilians</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43">Israel</label> says <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E33">its soldiers</label> use live ammunition only when <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E33">their</label> lives are in danger . </p>
<p>The proposed draft reiterates that <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E35">Jewish settlements in territory captured in the 1967 Mideast war</label> `` are illegal , 00270027 and an obstacle to peace . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31">The Security Council</label> resolution backed `` a speedy and objective inquiry 00270027 into the fighting . </p>
<p>The proposed <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14">General Assembly</label> resolution strongly supports `` a mechanism of inquiry 00270027 into the events and asks <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28">Annan</label> to report to <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14">the assembly</label> in 10 days on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28">his</label> efforts to establish such a mechanism . </p>
