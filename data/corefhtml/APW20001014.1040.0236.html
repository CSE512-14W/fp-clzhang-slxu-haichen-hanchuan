<p>General Assembly To Hold Meeting </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E25"><b>[0]</b>UNITED NATIONS</label> <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E40"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14"><b>[2]</b>The General Assembly</label> is expected to hold an emergency meeting next week on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E36"><b>[3]</b>the Middle East</label> to consider a resolution that would condemn `` excessive use of force '' by <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E44"><b>[5]</b>Israeli soldiers</label> , according to a draft obtained by <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E40"><b>[6]</b>The Associated Press</label> . </p>
<p>The draft is stronger than the resolution adopted by <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[7]</b>the Security Council</label> last Saturday , but the wording was softer on Israel compared to past resolutions on the <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43"><b>[8]</b>Israel-Palestinian</label> conflict . </p>
<p>The draft supports continued negotiations in search of peace and takes no side on divisive issues such as <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E47"><b>[10]</b>Jerusalem</label> , saying only that <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E48"><b>[11]</b>the holy places there</label> must be respected . </p>
<p>It also takes into account the security needs of both <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43"><b>[13]</b>Israelis</label> and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E46"><b>[14]</b>Palestinians</label> and expresses deep concern about casualties on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E51"><b>[15]</b>both sides</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E1"><b>[17]</b>Arab states</label> and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E3"><b>[18]</b>developing nations</label> asked for the emergency meeting Friday after <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[19]</b>the Security Council</label> indicated <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[20]</b>it</label> did not want another contentious session while diplomatic efforts were under way to end the violence that cost the lives of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E5"><b>[22]</b>96 people , most Palestinians</label> . </p>
<p>With <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E6"><b>[24]</b>a majority of the 189 U.N. member states</label> now supporting a special session on the current unrest , an emergency meeting is virtually certain . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E10"><b>[29]</b>Spokeswoman Sue Markham</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E12"><b>[32]</b>General Assembly President Harri Holkeri</label> will consult with <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E15"><b>[34]</b>other member states</label> on the request and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E16"><b>[36]</b>Arab diplomats</label> said a meeting is likely to be held early next week . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E17"><b>[38]</b>The Palestinian representative</label> , <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E17"><b>[39]</b>Nasser Al-Kidwa</label> , had originally requested an emergency meeting of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[40]</b>the Security Council</label> to adopt a new resolution , saying <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E19"><b>[42]</b>Israeli rocket</label> attacks on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E20"><b>[44]</b>Palestinian command centers</label> Thursday _ retaliation for the brutal lynching of <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E21"><b>[46]</b>two Israeli soldiers</label> _ were `` tantamount to the declaration of an overall war against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E46"><b>[48]</b>the entire Palestinian people</label> . </p>
<p>'' But <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E22"><b>[51]</b>U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E24"><b>[52]</b>the United States</label> would veto any new resolution and <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E27"><b>[53]</b>other council members</label> said <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E27"><b>[54]</b>they</label> wanted to give <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28"><b>[56]</b>Secretary-General Kofi Annan</label> time to negotiate a truce before taking any new action . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E51"><b>[57]</b>The two sides</label> announced Saturday <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E51"><b>[58]</b>they</label> would hold a summit in <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E30"><b>[59]</b>Egypt</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[60]</b>Security Council</label> resolutions have more clout because they are legally binding . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14"><b>[61]</b>General Assembly</label> resolutions are adopted by majority vote and cannot be vetoed , but are not legally binding . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[62]</b>Security Council</label> resolution last week condemned the `` excessive use of force '' against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E46"><b>[63]</b>the Palestinians</label> _ without naming <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43"><b>[64]</b>Israel</label> . </p>
<p>The <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14"><b>[65]</b>General Assembly</label> draft resolution would condemn `` the excessive use of force by <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E44"><b>[67]</b>the Israeli occupying forces</label> against <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E32"><b>[69]</b>Palestinian civilians</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E43"><b>[70]</b>Israel</label> says <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E33"><b>[72]</b>its soldiers</label> use live ammunition only when <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E33"><b>[73]</b>their</label> lives are in danger . </p>
<p>The proposed draft reiterates that <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E35"><b>[75]</b>Jewish settlements in territory captured in the 1967 Mideast war</label> `` are illegal , '' and an obstacle to peace . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E31"><b>[78]</b>The Security Council</label> resolution backed `` a speedy and objective inquiry '' into the fighting . </p>
<p>The proposed <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14"><b>[79]</b>General Assembly</label> resolution strongly supports `` a mechanism of inquiry '' into the events and asks <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28"><b>[80]</b>Annan</label> to report to <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E14"><b>[81]</b>the assembly</label> in 10 days on <label class="APW20001014.1040.0236-E28"><b>[82]</b>his</label> efforts to establish such a mechanism . </p>
