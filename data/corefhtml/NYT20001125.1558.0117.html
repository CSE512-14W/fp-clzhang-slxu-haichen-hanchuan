<p>SAFETY WORRIES INCREASE AS MICHIGAN HUNTERS TAKE GUNS UP TREES </p>
<p>0026 UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service 0026 LR ; 0026 QC ; 0026 QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E21">GROSSE POINTE PARK , Mich.</label> _ It is deer hunting season in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E43">Michigan</label> , and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E49">hunters who climb trees with loaded shotguns</label> have <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E50">state officials</label> redoubling safety education efforts . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E52">Two men</label> have been killed , and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E53">a third</label> has been injured since the hunting season opened on Nov. 15. All three accidents involved <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E55">shotguns</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E7">elevated platforms</label> and a practice relatively new to <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E54">Michigan hunters</label> _ shooting at deer from trees . </p>
<p>The <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E43">Michigan</label> season , one of the busiest , continues through Nov. 30. <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E16">Firearm</label> hunting from <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E7">elevated platforms</label> has long been legal in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E58">other states with heavy hunting , like New York and Pennsylvania</label> . </p>
<p>But the practice is only in its third season in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E43">Michigan</label> , and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E50">officials</label> say it appears that <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E54">hunters</label> still have a lot to learn about safety . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">Lt. Suzanne Koppelo</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">hunter safety administrator of the law enforcement division of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources</label> 0026 UR ; , 0026 LR ; said that since <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E16">firearm</label> <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E7">platform</label> hunting began in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E43">Michigan</label> there had been seven shooting accidents linked to the practice . </p>
<p>Three were fatal . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E52">Two hunters</label> shot <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E52">themselves</label> on <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E8">platforms</label> and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E53">another</label> was killed on <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E47">the ground</label> by <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E9">a hunter shooting from a platform</label> . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E11">hunters</label> exercised the kind of caution <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E12">one</label> would expect at heights of 20-some feet , it would be almost a nonissue , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">Koppelo</label> . </p>
<p>`` But given <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E13">human</label> nature , that 0027s not the case . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E14">More than 750,000 licensed hunters</label> are taking to <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E15">the Michigan woods</label> this year , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E15">where they are expected to kill about 500,000 of the state 0027s 1.9 million deer</label> . </p>
<p>The numbers reinforce the need to improve education about <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E7">platform</label> hunting with <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E16">firearms</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">Koppelo</label> said . </p>
<p>The practice is more commonly associated with <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E17">hunters using bows and arrows</label> . </p>
<p>Instead of hiding on <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E48">the ground</label> or walking through <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E45">the woods</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E17">they</label> wait quietly , typically at a height of 15 to 20 feet , and fire down at deer that wander below . </p>
<p>Despite <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E53">the hunter killed from the platform</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E19">Sgt. Larry D. Sargent</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E19">hunter education field coordinator for the law enforcement division</label> , says the practice does offer one safety advantage : errant shots typically thump harmlessly to <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E48">the ground</label> , rather than whistling through <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E45">the woods</label> and striking <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E23">other people</label> . </p>
<p>The problems primarily arise when <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E11">hunters</label> get in and out of position . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s kind of hard climbing a tree with <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E24">a gun</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">Rob Williams</label> said , as <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">he</label> and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E26">a hunting partner</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E26">Art Bush</label> , waited on a recent morning in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E28">a conventional earthbound hunting blind about 20 miles west of Detroit</label> . </p>
<p>For <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">Williams</label> , Rule No. 1 is not to climb a tree with <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E30">a loaded gun</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">He</label> says that when <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">he</label> hunts from <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E31">a platform</label> <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">he</label> climbs up with a rope dangling from <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">his</label> belt to <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E32">his gun , which he leaves unloaded on the ground</label> . </p>
<p>When <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">he</label> is secure in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E31">his stand</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">he</label> pulls <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E32">his gun</label> up after <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E25">him</label> and loads <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E32">it</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E19">Sargent</label> says this is proper procedure . </p>
<p>One accident this year , however , illustrates the importance of following each step of the safety procedures . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E33">A 16-year-old hunter</label> used a haul line , but it was tied to the trigger guard and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E33">he</label> left <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E34">the gun</label> loaded , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">Koppelo</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E34">The teen-ager 0027s gun</label> went off and <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E33">he</label> was shot in the foot . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E35">Others</label> are hurt falling out of trees . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">Koppelo</label> said that <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E50">state officials</label> were trying to keep count of these injuries but that it was difficult , since they relied on <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E54">hunters</label> reporting minor accidents . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E36">A lot of guys</label> are embarrassed , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E19">Sargent</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E36">They</label> 0027ll say <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E36">they</label> fell working in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E46">the yard</label> or something . </p>

<p>And <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E3">she</label> adds that though anecdotal reports show <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E38">Michigan 0027s large hunting population</label> to be taking slowly to <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E16">firearm</label> deer hunting from <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E7">platforms</label> , <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E39">most</label> expect the practice to catch on as it has in <label class="NYT20001125.1558.0117-E40">other states</label> . </p>
