<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E20"><b>[0]</b>SPRINGFIELD , Mass.</label> _ `` There was a coldness in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E33"><b>[1]</b>Ward C</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[2]</b>the prosecutor</label> began <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[3]</b>his</label> wintry tale of white-coated murder this week . </p>
<p>`` It was a deep , eerie , unsettling feeling that something terribly , terribly wrong was happening , '' <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[4]</b>Assistant U.S. Attorney William Welch II</label> went on . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E37"><b>[5]</b>Patients</label> were succumbing to sudden cardiac arrest at an alarming and suspicious rate . </p>
<p>Finally , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[6]</b>he</label> said , in February 1996 , `` <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E38"><b>[7]</b>three registered nurses</label> came forward to report <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E39"><b>[8]</b>a patient</label> 's , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E40"><b>[9]</b>a health care professional</label> 's , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E41"><b>[10]</b>a hospital</label> 's worst nightmare : There was <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E42"><b>[11]</b>a killer</label> amongst <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E30"><b>[12]</b>them</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E42"><b>[13]</b>That killer</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13"><b>[14]</b>prosecutors</label> charge , is <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[15]</b>Kristen Gilbert , 33</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[16]</b>a former nurse , who is on trial in federal court here , accused of murdering four patients and trying to kill three others by poisoning them with epinephrine , a stimulant that sent their hearts racing out of control</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E6"><b>[17]</b>Massachusetts</label> is <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E6"><b>[18]</b>one of 12 states that lack the death penalty</label> , but <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[19]</b>Gilbert</label> 's is a capital case nonetheless , because the alleged crimes occurred on <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E9"><b>[20]</b>federal property</label> _ <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E9"><b>[21]</b>the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northampton , Mass.</label> And so the case is being tried in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E12"><b>[22]</b>federal court , where prosecutors can , and say they will , seek the death penalty</label> . </p>
<p>In an opening argument on Monday , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14"><b>[23]</b>the defense lawyer</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14"><b>[24]</b>David P. Hoose</label> , emphasized that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E16"><b>[25]</b>no one</label> had seen <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[26]</b>Gilbert</label> poison <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E5"><b>[27]</b>the patients</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14"><b>[28]</b>He</label> said that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E5"><b>[29]</b>the patients</label> were very sick and that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13"><b>[30]</b>the prosecution</label> 's claims that evidence of epinephrine poisoning was found in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E17"><b>[31]</b>the exhumed bodies of patients</label> were based on shoddy science . </p>
<p>The case is really about `` an investigation that started with a conclusion and then worked backwards to fill in the gaps , '' <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14"><b>[32]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And the proposition <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13"><b>[33]</b>they</label> started with was that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E18"><b>[34]</b>people</label> were injected with epinephrine , and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[35]</b>Kristen Gilbert</label> did it . </p>
<p>'' As <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[36]</b>Welch</label> depicted <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[37]</b>her</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[38]</b>Gilbert</label> reveled in the excitement and attention of the emergency calls made whenever a life-threatening situation arose , and went out of <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[39]</b>her</label> way to create emergencies by injecting <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E19"><b>[40]</b>patients</label> with epinephrine . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[41]</b>She</label> had a particular reason to crave that spotlight , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[42]</b>he</label> said : Though married and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[43]</b>the mother of two boys</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[44]</b>she</label> began an affair in late 1995 with <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23"><b>[45]</b>one of the hospital 's security police</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23"><b>[46]</b>James Perrault</label> , and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23"><b>[47]</b>he</label> would be summoned to help whenever an emergency call was made . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[48]</b>Welch</label> also said <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[49]</b>Gilbert</label> had confessed to <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23"><b>[50]</b>Perrault , who would testify</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34"><b>[51]</b>Welch</label> described a pivotal moment on Feb. 15 , 1996 , when <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27"><b>[52]</b>a suspicious colleague of Gilbert 's</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27"><b>[53]</b>Kathy Rix</label> , counted three ampules in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E29"><b>[54]</b>the intensive care unit</label> 's medicine cabinet at 4 p.m. ; an hour later , after an emergency call that involved <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1"><b>[55]</b>Gilbert</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27"><b>[56]</b>she</label> counted again and found none , and then saw three broken ampules in the needle disposal bucket . </p>
