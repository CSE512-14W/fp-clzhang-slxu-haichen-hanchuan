<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E20">SPRINGFIELD , Mass.</label> _ `` There was a coldness in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E33">Ward C</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">the prosecutor</label> began <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">his</label> wintry tale of white-coated murder this week . </p>
<p>`` It was a deep , eerie , unsettling feeling that something terribly , terribly wrong was happening , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">Assistant U.S. Attorney William Welch II</label> went on . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E37">Patients</label> were succumbing to sudden cardiac arrest at an alarming and suspicious rate . </p>
<p>Finally , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">he</label> said , in February 1996 , `` <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E38">three registered nurses</label> came forward to report <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E39">a patient</label> 0027s , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E40">a health care professional</label> 0027s , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E41">a hospital</label> 0027s worst nightmare : There was <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E42">a killer</label> amongst <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E30">them</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E42">That killer</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13">prosecutors</label> charge , is <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Kristen Gilbert , 33</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">a former nurse , who is on trial in federal court here , accused of murdering four patients and trying to kill three others by poisoning them with epinephrine , a stimulant that sent their hearts racing out of control</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E6">Massachusetts</label> is <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E6">one of 12 states that lack the death penalty</label> , but <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Gilbert</label> 0027s is a capital case nonetheless , because the alleged crimes occurred on <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E9">federal property</label> _ <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E9">the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northampton , Mass.</label> And so the case is being tried in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E12">federal court , where prosecutors can , and say they will , seek the death penalty</label> . </p>
<p>In an opening argument on Monday , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14">the defense lawyer</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14">David P. Hoose</label> , emphasized that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E16">no one</label> had seen <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Gilbert</label> poison <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E5">the patients</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14">He</label> said that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E5">the patients</label> were very sick and that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13">the prosecution</label> 0027s claims that evidence of epinephrine poisoning was found in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E17">the exhumed bodies of patients</label> were based on shoddy science . </p>
<p>The case is really about `` an investigation that started with a conclusion and then worked backwards to fill in the gaps , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E14">he</label> said . </p>
<p>`` And the proposition <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E13">they</label> started with was that <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E18">people</label> were injected with epinephrine , and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Kristen Gilbert</label> did it . </p>
<p>00270027 As <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">Welch</label> depicted <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">her</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Gilbert</label> reveled in the excitement and attention of the emergency calls made whenever a life-threatening situation arose , and went out of <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">her</label> way to create emergencies by injecting <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E19">patients</label> with epinephrine . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">She</label> had a particular reason to crave that spotlight , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">he</label> said : Though married and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">the mother of two boys</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">she</label> began an affair in late 1995 with <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23">one of the hospital 0027s security police</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23">James Perrault</label> , and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23">he</label> would be summoned to help whenever an emergency call was made . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">Welch</label> also said <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Gilbert</label> had confessed to <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E23">Perrault , who would testify</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">Welch</label> described a pivotal moment on Feb. 15 , 1996 , when <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">a suspicious colleague of Gilbert 0027s</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">Kathy Rix</label> , counted three ampules in <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E29">the intensive care unit</label> 0027s medicine cabinet at 4 p.m. ; an hour later , after an emergency call that involved <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E1">Gilbert</label> , <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">she</label> counted again and found none , and then saw three broken ampules in the needle disposal bucket . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">She</label> felt sick to <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">her</label> stomach and <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">her</label> knees about buckled , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E34">Welch</label> said , `` because <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E27">she</label> now knew what had been happening on <label class="NYT20001122.2009.0341-E33">Ward C.</label> 00270027 </p>
