<p>The <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19">vice-presidential</label> debate on Thursday between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E20">Sen. Joseph Lieberman</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E22">Dick Cheney</label> was watched by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E23">at least 28.5 million people</label> , <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E23">the second-smallest audience on record for a vice-presidential debate</label> , according to <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E25">Nielsen Media Research</label> data . </p>
<p>The lowest-rated <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19">vice-presidential</label> debate on record was the confrontation between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E26">Vice President Al Gore</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E28">Jack Kemp</label> , on Oct. 9 , 1996 . </p>
<p>It was watched by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E29">26.6 million people</label> . </p>
<p>The highest-rated <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19">vice-presidential</label> debate was the matchup between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E30">Rep. Geraldine Ferraro</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E1">Vice President George Bush</label> , on Oct. 11 , 1984 . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E4">Nielsen executives</label> said it was possible that the final <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E5">audience</label> tally for Thursday 's confrontation could be slightly larger than the one released Friday . </p>
<p>The ratings gathering process was complicated by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E6">Fox</label> 's decision to show a baseball playoff game instead of the debate . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E7">Some of its affiliated stations</label> showed the debate later in the evening , and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E9">Nielsen</label> said <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E9">it</label> would not be able to count the number of <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E10">people who watched those showings</label> until early next week . </p>
<p>The difference was not expected to be very significant . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E11">Thursday 's estimated audience</label> included <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E12">viewers who watched on ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC , CNN and the Fox News Channel</label> . </p>
