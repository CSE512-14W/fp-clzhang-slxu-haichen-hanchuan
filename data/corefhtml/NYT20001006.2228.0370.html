<p>The <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19"><b>[0]</b>vice-presidential</label> debate on Thursday between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E20"><b>[2]</b>Sen. Joseph Lieberman</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E22"><b>[3]</b>Dick Cheney</label> was watched by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E23"><b>[4]</b>at least 28.5 million people</label> , <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E23"><b>[5]</b>the second-smallest audience on record for a vice-presidential debate</label> , according to <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E25"><b>[7]</b>Nielsen Media Research</label> data . </p>
<p>The lowest-rated <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19"><b>[8]</b>vice-presidential</label> debate on record was the confrontation between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E26"><b>[10]</b>Vice President Al Gore</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E28"><b>[11]</b>Jack Kemp</label> , on Oct. 9 , 1996 . </p>
<p>It was watched by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E29"><b>[12]</b>26.6 million people</label> . </p>
<p>The highest-rated <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E19"><b>[13]</b>vice-presidential</label> debate was the matchup between <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E30"><b>[15]</b>Rep. Geraldine Ferraro</label> and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E1"><b>[17]</b>Vice President George Bush</label> , on Oct. 11 , 1984 . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E4"><b>[20]</b>Nielsen executives</label> said it was possible that the final <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E5"><b>[21]</b>audience</label> tally for Thursday 's confrontation could be slightly larger than the one released Friday . </p>
<p>The ratings gathering process was complicated by <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E6"><b>[22]</b>Fox</label> 's decision to show a baseball playoff game instead of the debate . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E7"><b>[23]</b>Some of its affiliated stations</label> showed the debate later in the evening , and <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E9"><b>[26]</b>Nielsen</label> said <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E9"><b>[27]</b>it</label> would not be able to count the number of <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E10"><b>[28]</b>people who watched those showings</label> until early next week . </p>
<p>The difference was not expected to be very significant . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E11"><b>[30]</b>Thursday 's estimated audience</label> included <label class="NYT20001006.2228.0370-E12"><b>[31]</b>viewers who watched on ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC , CNN and the Fox News Channel</label> . </p>
