<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E5"><b>[0]</b>SEATTLE</label> _ The answers to the three most commonly asked questions at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17"><b>[1]</b>the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle</label> these days are : one , 235 pounds ; two , 22 months ( the longest pregnancy of any mammal in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E18"><b>[3]</b>the world</label> ) ; three , natural insemination , after her 8,800-pound mother was transported 2,000 miles for a tryst in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E19"><b>[4]</b>Missouri</label> . </p>
<p>The questions concern a baby <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20"><b>[5]</b>Asian</label> elephant , the first one born at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17"><b>[6]</b>the zoo</label> in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10"><b>[7]</b>its</label> 100-year history . </p>
<p>The 8-week-old elephant has quickly become a local sensation , and her presence has doubled the normal attendance figures and inspired <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E21"><b>[8]</b>some visitors</label> to wait as long as two hours _ yes , often in the rain at this time of year _ to look at her . </p>
<p>The three questions are : How much did she weigh at birth ? </p>
<p>How long was she in there ? </p>
<p>How was she conceived ? </p>
<p>The answer to the last question is of particular interest to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E22"><b>[9]</b>elephant experts around the world , who consider any successful experiment in breeding an important victory because elephants are endangered , especially the Asian species , whose numbers have declined steadily to about 40,000 in the wild</label> . </p>
<p>The baby elephant in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E5"><b>[13]</b>Seattle</label> is one of three <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20"><b>[14]</b>Asian</label> elephants born in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E23"><b>[16]</b>North American zoos</label> this year , one of which died shortly after birth , said <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2"><b>[17]</b>Mike Keele</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2"><b>[18]</b>the coordinator for the elephant species survival program of American Zoo and Aquarium Association</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2"><b>[20]</b>Keele</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2"><b>[21]</b>an assistant director at the Oregon Zoo in Portland</label> , said that artificial insemination had worked in only a handful of cases worldwide . </p>
<p>At <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17"><b>[25]</b>the Seattle zoo</label> , efforts to artificially inseminate a 21-year-old <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20"><b>[26]</b>Asian</label> elephant failed to produce a pregnancy after six years . </p>
<p>So in September 1998 , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10"><b>[27]</b>the zoo</label> loaded the elephant , whose name is Chai , on <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E6"><b>[28]</b>a flatbed truck</label> and sent her to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E7"><b>[29]</b>the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield , Mo.</label> There , Chai met up with Onyx , an 11,000-pound sire . </p>
<p>Female elephants ovulate once every 16 weeks and then have only about a 24-hour window to become pregnant . </p>
<p>After the first attempt failed , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E9"><b>[33]</b>zoo officials</label> said Chai appeared to enter into a funk in her unfamiliar surroundings and lost about 1,000 pounds . </p>
<p>But in the second cycle , in January 1999 , she became pregnant and quickly regained the weight . </p>
<p>The 22-month-long gestation ended at 4:48 a.m. on Nov. 3. The birth was captured on a video , which is available at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10"><b>[35]</b>the Seattle zoo</label> 's Web site , www . </p>
<p>zoo . </p>
<p>org . </p>
<p>Another frequent question is this : Does the baby have a name ? </p>
<p>Not yet . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10"><b>[36]</b>The zoo</label> plans to have a contest to name the baby beginning in February , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E12"><b>[37]</b>David L. Towne</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E12"><b>[38]</b>president and director of the zoo</label> , said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E14"><b>[40]</b>The person who submits the winning name , which Towne said should evoke the elephant 's Asian heritage</label> , will receive a trip for two to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E15"><b>[44]</b>Thailand , where Chai is from</label> . </p>
