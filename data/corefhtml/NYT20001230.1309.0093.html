<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E5">SEATTLE</label> _ The answers to the three most commonly asked questions at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17">the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle</label> these days are : one , 235 pounds ; two , 22 months ( the longest pregnancy of any mammal in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E18">the world</label> ) ; three , natural insemination , after her 8,800-pound mother was transported 2,000 miles for a tryst in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E19">Missouri</label> . </p>
<p>The questions concern a baby <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20">Asian</label> elephant , the first one born at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17">the zoo</label> in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10">its</label> 100-year history . </p>
<p>The 8-week-old elephant has quickly become a local sensation , and her presence has doubled the normal attendance figures and inspired <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E21">some visitors</label> to wait as long as two hours _ yes , often in the rain at this time of year _ to look at her . </p>
<p>The three questions are : How much did she weigh at birth ? </p>
<p>How long was she in there ? </p>
<p>How was she conceived ? </p>
<p>The answer to the last question is of particular interest to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E22">elephant experts around the world , who consider any successful experiment in breeding an important victory because elephants are endangered , especially the Asian species , whose numbers have declined steadily to about 40,000 in the wild</label> . </p>
<p>The baby elephant in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E5">Seattle</label> is one of three <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20">Asian</label> elephants born in <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E23">North American zoos</label> this year , one of which died shortly after birth , said <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2">Mike Keele</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2">the coordinator for the elephant species survival program of American Zoo and Aquarium Association</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2">Keele</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E2">an assistant director at the Oregon Zoo in Portland</label> , said that artificial insemination had worked in only a handful of cases worldwide . </p>
<p>At <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E17">the Seattle zoo</label> , efforts to artificially inseminate a 21-year-old <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E20">Asian</label> elephant failed to produce a pregnancy after six years . </p>
<p>So in September 1998 , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10">the zoo</label> loaded the elephant , whose name is Chai , on <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E6">a flatbed truck</label> and sent her to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E7">the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield , Mo.</label> There , Chai met up with Onyx , an 11,000-pound sire . </p>
<p>Female elephants ovulate once every 16 weeks and then have only about a 24-hour window to become pregnant . </p>
<p>After the first attempt failed , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E9">zoo officials</label> said Chai appeared to enter into a funk in her unfamiliar surroundings and lost about 1,000 pounds . </p>
<p>But in the second cycle , in January 1999 , she became pregnant and quickly regained the weight . </p>
<p>The 22-month-long gestation ended at 4:48 a.m. on Nov. 3. The birth was captured on a video , which is available at <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10">the Seattle zoo</label> 0027s Web site , www . </p>
<p>zoo . </p>
<p>org . </p>
<p>Another frequent question is this : Does the baby have a name ? </p>
<p>Not yet . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E10">The zoo</label> plans to have a contest to name the baby beginning in February , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E12">David L. Towne</label> , <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E12">president and director of the zoo</label> , said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E14">The person who submits the winning name , which Towne said should evoke the elephant 0027s Asian heritage</label> , will receive a trip for two to <label class="NYT20001230.1309.0093-E15">Thailand , where Chai is from</label> . </p>
