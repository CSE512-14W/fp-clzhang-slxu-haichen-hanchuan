<p>Skepticism Greets Fox 0027s Border Plan </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E22">BROWNSVILLE , Texas</label> (AP) _ In speech after speech , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Mexico President Vicente Fox</label> argues for <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">his</label> dream : A free flow of <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E69">workers</label> across <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E70">an open border</label> , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E70">an international boundary that ceases to be a barrier</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E6">the 2,000-mile frontier between Mexico and the United States</label> is delineated by <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E76">steel walls</label> and <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E1">barbed wire</label> , watched over by <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E2">uniformed guards from the Border Patrol</label> . </p>
<p>`` It will never happen , 00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E4">Rosalinda Arebalo of neighboring Matamoros , Mexico</label> , said flatly of <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox</label> 0027s dream . </p>
<p>`` If it did , it would be a miracle . </p>
<p>00270027 If anything , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E6">the border</label> is closing down . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">The United States</label> announced plans this fall to step up <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E6">border</label> security with <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E7">1,300 miles of road and fence</label> , cameras and thousands of portable floodlights . </p>
<p>From 1993 through 1999 , the number of <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E8">Border Patrol agents</label> doubled from 4,000 to 8,000 . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E10">I</label> 0027ll be honest , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">your country</label> is n0027t ready for it , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E10">Fernando Kleinfingher</label> , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E10">a computer consultant in Tijuana , Mexico</label> . </p>
<p>`` It would be very hard for <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">America</label> to accept . </p>
<p>00270027 `` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">The United States</label> will never allow <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E23">an open border</label> , 00270027 predicted <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E14">Faustino Avalos</label> , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E14">a 65-year-old farmer strolling home to Matamoros</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">They</label> only want <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E26">Mexicans</label> to visit and buy things . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E16">The undocumented workers</label> get nothing but injustice . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E17">Economists</label> say the skepticism is well-founded . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s a totally unrealistic proposal , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E18">Steve Bronars</label> , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E18">a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin</label> . </p>
<p>`` It 0027s just not something that 0027s going to happen . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox , who was sworn into office Friday</label> , first pledged to open <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E6">the border</label> during a heated campaign to overturn <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E21">the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party</label> . </p>
<p>Pressed for details after <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">his</label> July election , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E70">the former Coca-Cola executive</label> revised <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">his</label> scheme , promising to bring <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E26">Mexican</label> wages up to <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">U.S.</label> standards and open <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E6">the border</label> within 10 years , although <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">he</label> remains vague about a schedule . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E17">Economists</label> say an unfettered flow of <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E69">Mexican workers</label> could drive wages down and strain social services to the breaking point , particularly in <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E27">border states</label> . </p>
<p>On top of that , adds <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E28">El Paso Mayor Carlos Ramirez</label> : `` There are safety issues of drugs , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E31">terrorists</label> and contraband . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E32">President Clinton</label> and <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E34">Vice President Al Gore</label> were noncommittal in August meetings with <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox</label> . </p>
<p>And <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E36">Texas Gov. George W. Bush</label> said <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E36">he</label> supported `` a humane way 00270027 of cracking down on migration from `` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E26">our friendly neighbor to the south</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 `` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E36">I</label> appreciate ( <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox</label> 0027s ) optimistic vision , 00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E36">Bush</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E39">Mark Krikorian</label> , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E39">director of the nonpartisan , Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies</label> , believes <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox</label> 0027s call for <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E23">an open border</label> is a `` bargaining chip . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">Fox</label> will demand <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E23">a porous boundary</label> and then settle for an increase in legal migration , <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E39">he</label> predicted . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E66">He</label> 0027s hoping <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">the United States</label> will split the difference , 00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E39">Krikorian</label> said . </p>
<p>It 0027s a good time to cut a deal . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">U.S.</label> unemployment is at its lowest in three decades and there are <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E43">fewer people to fill low-skilled jobs in farms , restaurants and factories</label> . </p>
<p>That scenario rings familiar to <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E47">Arebalo , 49 , who went from Matamoros to North Carolina to work in soybean fields when she was a girl</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E51">Her family</label> needed the money and <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E52">the farms</label> needed the help . </p>
<p>Those were the days of the Bracero Program , World War II-era legislation that beckoned <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E54">thousands of Mexican nationals</label> to replenish <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E55">a dwindling U.S. labor pool</label> . </p>
<p>In 1954 , a <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E53">military-style</label> <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E56">Immigration and Naturalization Service</label> campaign called `` Operation Wetback 00270027 drove <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E57">about 1 million illegal immigrants</label> back into <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E26">Mexico</label> . </p>
<p>Ten years later , the Bracero Program fizzled out . </p>
<p>`` Back then it was simple to get papers to work <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E12">here</label> , and <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E58">you</label> could just come across , 00270027 <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E47">Arebalo</label> said as <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E47">she</label> stepped off <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E65">the international bridge</label> into <label class="APW20001202.2035.0562-E60">Brownsville 0027s shopping district</label> . </p>
<p>`` But then everything changed . </p>
