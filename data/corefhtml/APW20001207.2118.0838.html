<p>Ancient Bird Fuels Dinosaur Debate </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E22"><b>[0]</b>WASHINGTON</label> <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E24"><b>[1]</b>(AP)</label> _ Fossil remains of a 120 million-year-old bird with unique feathers cast doubt on the theory of birds evolving from dinosaurs , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E25"><b>[2]</b>some experts</label> say , but <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E26"><b>[3]</b>others</label> disagree . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E27"><b>[5]</b>Two Chinese researchers</label> report that a fossil called Protopteryx _ from a group of flying animals called Enantiornithine _ includes feathers that are `` different from those of all other known fossil and modern feathers . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[6]</b>Fucheng Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[7]</b>Zhonghe Zhou</label> of <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E31"><b>[8]</b>the Chinese Academy of Sciences</label> suggest in the journal Science that the discovery supports the idea that feathers evolved from scales , like those found in reptiles . </p>
<p>The study was to be published Friday . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E32"><b>[9]</b>Some researchers who oppose the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs</label> embraced the new fossil as proof that birds and dinosaurs evolved independently from a common reptilian ancestor . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E33"><b>[11]</b>others</label> say Protopteryx adds nothing to the dino-bird debate . </p>
<p>`` There is nothing in the skeleton of this bird that disputes the dinosaur origin of birds , '' said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[12]</b>Thomas R. Holtz Jr.</label> , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[14]</b>a University of Maryland paleobiologist and specialists on bird evolution</label> . </p>
<p>`` The fact that this Protopteryx has these weird flat feathers really does n't affect that issue . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E2"><b>[15]</b>Alan Feduccia</label> , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E2"><b>[16]</b>an evolutionary biologist at the University of North Carolina</label> , said the <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E28"><b>[18]</b>Chinese</label> study of Protopteryx `` is a hot paper ... that directly contradicts the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs . </p>
<p>'' The new fossil was unveiled the day after <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E5"><b>[19]</b>researchers</label> announced that another ancient <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E28"><b>[20]</b>Chinese</label> bird , called Microraptor zhaoianus , supported the dinosaur origin of birds . </p>
<p>In the study , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[21]</b>Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[22]</b>Zhou</label> described the feather and bone structure found in a fossil of a starling-sized bird uncovered in <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E6"><b>[23]</b>northern China</label> , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E6"><b>[24]</b>the site of many dinosaur fossil finds</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E27"><b>[26]</b>The Chinese researchers</label> said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers , but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on Archaeopteryx , the earliest known bird . </p>
<p>Archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago , while Protopteryx was dated as more recent , about 120 million years ago . </p>
<p>Microraptor , which was about the size of a crow , lived about 125 million years ago . </p>
<p>Some elements of the Protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure match those of modern birds , said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[27]</b>Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[28]</b>Zhou</label> , but the wing retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals . </p>
<p>In modern birds , that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the wing . </p>
<p>Nonetheless , Protopteryx is thought to have been a competent flier . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E8"><b>[29]</b>Most dinosaur researchers</label> believe birds evolved 150 to 180 million years ago from a dinosaur group called Theropods . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E9"><b>[30]</b>Researchers</label> cite fundamental skeleton similarities to support the theory . </p>
<p>The evolution of feathers , however , has been less clear . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E10"><b>[31]</b>Some experts</label> believe feathers evolved specifically to support flight , while <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E11"><b>[32]</b>others</label> say feathers evolved first to provide warmth or protection from water . </p>
<p>Fossils of three theropods bear hairlike images that <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E12"><b>[33]</b>some</label> say could be the early precursors to feathers . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E2"><b>[34]</b>Feduccia</label> dismisses the theropod hair as `` dino fuzz '' and cites the <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[35]</b>Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[36]</b>Zhou</label> paper as proof that feathers evolved from reptilian scales and that this could mean that birds evolved independent of dinosaurs . </p>
<p>`` Bird feathers are very closely related to scales , '' said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E2"><b>[37]</b>Feduccia</label> . </p>
<p>`` It is clear they evolved from elongated scales . </p>
<p>Dino fuzz has nothing to do with feathers . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E15"><b>[38]</b>Larry Martin</label> , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E15"><b>[40]</b>a University of Kansas paleontologist</label> , said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E27"><b>[42]</b>the Chinese researchers</label> ' paper `` is the strongest evidence yet that bird feathers evolved for flight and that they were derived from scales . </p>
<p>'' <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[43]</b>Holtz</label> , however , notes that Protopteryx , with its primitive feathers , lived millions of years after Archaeopteryx , which had feathers almost identical to those of modern birds . </p>
<p>`` This means the feathers on Protopteryx were probably an evolutionary reversal , '' said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[44]</b>Holtz</label> , adding that there are many examples where such reversals occur in nature . </p>
<p>`` This just shows that feathers are extremely adaptable structures , '' <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[45]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E17"><b>[46]</b>Michael Novacek</label> , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E17"><b>[47]</b>a dinosaur expert at the American Museum of Natural History in New York</label> , says that the <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[50]</b>Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[51]</b>Zhou</label> study is `` ambiguous '' on the issue of dinosaurs and birds . </p>
<p>`` The fact that <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E21"><b>[52]</b>you</label> see a resemblance between scales and feathers does n't eliminate dinosaurs as close relatives to birds , '' said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E17"><b>[53]</b>Novacek</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E17"><b>[54]</b>He</label> , too , said that evolution reversals are not rare . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E17"><b>[55]</b>He</label> said , for example , that whale ancestors lived on land and had fur , but evolution carried the huge mammals back to the sea . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[56]</b>Holtz</label> said the <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13"><b>[57]</b>Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14"><b>[58]</b>Zhou</label> study is important because it adds new understanding about the Enantiornithine , a bird group that dominated the latter part of the age of dinosaurs . </p>
<p>`` The Enantiornithine got clobbered in the extinction event '' that killed off the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago , <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[59]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p>This was followed by the dominance of another bird group , the Ornithurae , which later evolved into modern birds , said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E34"><b>[60]</b>Holtz</label> . </p>
