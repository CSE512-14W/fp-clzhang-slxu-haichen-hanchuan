<p><label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E27">The Chinese researchers</label> said the feathers have some of the characteristics of modern feathers , but the structure is more primitive than feathers found on Archaeopteryx , the earliest known bird . </p>
<p>Archaeopteryx appeared about 145 million years ago , while Protopteryx was dated as more recent , about 120 million years ago . </p>
<p>Microraptor , which was about the size of a crow , lived about 125 million years ago . </p>
<p>Some elements of the Protopteryx wing bone and muscle structure match those of modern birds , said <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E13">Zhang</label> and <label class="APW20001207.2118.0838-E14">Zhou</label> , but the wing retains a claw found on some primitive birdlike animals . </p>
<p>In modern birds , that claw has disappeared and been replaced with a structure that adds lift to the wing . </p>
