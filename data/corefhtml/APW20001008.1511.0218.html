<p>Those conflicts were marked by horrific acts of violence against <label class="APW20001008.1511.0218-E38">civilians</label> , which prompted <label class="APW20001008.1511.0218-E39">Western governments</label> to impose sanctions and isolate <label class="APW20001008.1511.0218-E40">the government in Belgrade</label> . </p>
