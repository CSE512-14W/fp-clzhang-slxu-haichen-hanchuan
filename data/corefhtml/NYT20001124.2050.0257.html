<p>EXPANDING ASIAN ECONOMIES DEFY CAUTIOUS FORECASTS BY INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">HONG KONG</label> _ For most of this year , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia</label> 0027s economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E46">economists</label> predicted they would fall to <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E47">earth</label> . </p>
<p>That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday : <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">Hong Kong</label> reported that <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">its</label> economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter , and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">it</label> raised <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">its</label> projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent . </p>
<p>Yet a block away , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">the International Monetary Fund</label> warned in a news conference that <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asian</label> economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">The IMF</label> said a $ 5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E2">Asian countries</label> next year . </p>
<p>`` The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">David Robinson</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">assistant director of research at the fund</label> . </p>
<p>`` There has also been increased political instability across <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E5">the world</label> , not least in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E6">Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines , Taiwan , and Indonesia</label> _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E10">The Philippines president</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E10">Joseph Estrada</label> , was impeached last week , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E13">Chen Shui-bian</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E13">the president of Taiwan</label> , is trying to fend off a recall vote . </p>
<p>Even in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E15">more stable countries , like Malaysia and South Korea</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">the Fund</label> was concerned by the haphazard pace of economic reforms . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E18">many countries</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E19">the banks and corporations</label> remain financially shaky . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">We</label> 0027re still seeing <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E20">chaebols in deep trouble</label> , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">he</label> said , referring to <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E20">Korea 0027s heavily indebted conglomerates</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been reflected in the economic performance of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E15">the countries</label> . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E16">South Korea</label> reported a 9.2 percent increase in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E16">its</label> third-quarter output _ beating the estimates of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E22">most analysts</label> and extending a string of powerful quarters . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E9">Indonesia</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E17">Malaysia</label> , and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E23">Singapore</label> have also beaten expectations , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">Hong Kong</label> 0027s growth rate was nearly three percentage points above a median forecast of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E24">12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News</label> . </p>
<p>Like other <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asian</label> economies , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">Hong Kong</label> has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">its</label> exports , principally in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26">the United States</label> . </p>
<p>Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">Hong Kong</label> has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E27">mainland China</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28">Consumer</label> spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent , as retail sales slackened from the second quarter . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28">consumer</label> prices fell 2 percent , extending a decline that began during the crisis . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29">Ian Perkin</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29">chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce</label> said the double-digit growth in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21">Hong Kong</label> and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E32">other Asian countries</label> masked <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E33">their</label> underlying condition . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E34">the region</label> 0027s growth in exports has been torrid , domestic demand has remained tenuous . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E35">We</label> have n0027t built up <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E35">our</label> domestic economies yet , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29">he</label> said . </p>
<p>`` The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28">consumer</label> spending slows down in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26">the States</label> , it will have a devastating effect on <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia</label> , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29">Perkin</label> . </p>
<p>`` 2001 could be a crunch year . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson of the IMF</label> was similarly wary about next year . </p>
<p>In October , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">the IMF</label> projected that the <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E5">world</label> economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001 , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia as a region</label> would grow 6.6 percent . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> said the growth rate could be lower , though <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">he</label> would not say by how much . </p>
<p>A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E38">many Asian countries</label> on imported oil . </p>
<p>Oil prices have risen $ 5 per barrel since <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">the IMF</label> issued <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48">its</label> semi-annual economic outlook in October . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia</label> has little control over oil , but <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">the region</label> could improve <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">its</label> economic prospects by calming <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">its</label> political waters . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E39">One bright spot in the Asian landscape</label> is <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E39">China , which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> said the main question facing <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E41">Chinese leaders</label> was whether <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E41">they</label> need to spend billions of dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding . </p>
<p>Like <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29">Perkin</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1">Asia</label> 0027s future depended in large part on the health of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26">the United States</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">he</label> disputed <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E43">those who predict dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the American economy</label> . </p>
<p>`` The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3">he</label> said , `` substantially less . </p>
