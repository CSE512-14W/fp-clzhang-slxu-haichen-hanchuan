<p>EXPANDING ASIAN ECONOMIES DEFY CAUTIOUS FORECASTS BY INTERNATIONAL </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[0]</b>HONG KONG</label> _ For most of this year , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[1]</b>Asia</label> 's economies have performed a sort of levitating act _ growing by double-digit rates month after month even as <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E46"><b>[2]</b>economists</label> predicted they would fall to <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E47"><b>[3]</b>earth</label> . </p>
<p>That dichotomy was on vivid display here Friday : <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[4]</b>Hong Kong</label> reported that <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[5]</b>its</label> economic output surged 10.4 percent in the third quarter , and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[6]</b>it</label> raised <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[7]</b>its</label> projection for full-year growth to 10 percent from 8.5 percent . </p>
<p>Yet a block away , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[8]</b>the International Monetary Fund</label> warned in a news conference that <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[9]</b>Asian</label> economies could be hit hard by soaring oil prices and turmoil in the financial markets . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[10]</b>The IMF</label> said a $ 5 increase in the price of a barrel of oil could slow the growth rates of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E2"><b>[12]</b>Asian countries</label> next year . </p>
<p>`` The prospects for growth in 2001 have weakened , '' said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[13]</b>David Robinson</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[14]</b>assistant director of research at the fund</label> . </p>
<p>`` There has also been increased political instability across <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E5"><b>[16]</b>the world</label> , not least in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[17]</b>Asia</label> . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E6"><b>[19]</b>Several Asian countries _ notably the Philippines , Taiwan , and Indonesia</label> _ have been gripped by political tumult in recent weeks . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E10"><b>[24]</b>The Philippines president</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E10"><b>[25]</b>Joseph Estrada</label> , was impeached last week , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E13"><b>[26]</b>Chen Shui-bian</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E13"><b>[27]</b>the president of Taiwan</label> , is trying to fend off a recall vote . </p>
<p>Even in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E15"><b>[29]</b>more stable countries , like Malaysia and South Korea</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[32]</b>Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[33]</b>the Fund</label> was concerned by the haphazard pace of economic reforms . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E18"><b>[34]</b>many countries</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E19"><b>[35]</b>the banks and corporations</label> remain financially shaky . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[36]</b>We</label> 're still seeing <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E20"><b>[37]</b>chaebols in deep trouble</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[38]</b>he</label> said , referring to <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E20"><b>[40]</b>Korea 's heavily indebted conglomerates</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[41]</b>Robinson</label> acknowledged that these weaknesses had not yet been reflected in the economic performance of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E15"><b>[42]</b>the countries</label> . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E16"><b>[43]</b>South Korea</label> reported a 9.2 percent increase in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E16"><b>[44]</b>its</label> third-quarter output _ beating the estimates of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E22"><b>[45]</b>most analysts</label> and extending a string of powerful quarters . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E9"><b>[46]</b>Indonesia</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E17"><b>[47]</b>Malaysia</label> , and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E23"><b>[48]</b>Singapore</label> have also beaten expectations , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[49]</b>Hong Kong</label> 's growth rate was nearly three percentage points above a median forecast of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E24"><b>[50]</b>12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News</label> . </p>
<p>Like other <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[52]</b>Asian</label> economies , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[53]</b>Hong Kong</label> has been buoyed by an unquenchable appetite for <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[54]</b>its</label> exports , principally in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26"><b>[55]</b>the United States</label> . </p>
<p>Exports surged 17.7 percent in the third quarter . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[56]</b>Hong Kong</label> has done a particularly booming business in repackaging and shipping goods from <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E27"><b>[57]</b>mainland China</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28"><b>[58]</b>Consumer</label> spending rose by a much less impressive 5.6 percent , as retail sales slackened from the second quarter . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28"><b>[59]</b>consumer</label> prices fell 2 percent , extending a decline that began during the crisis . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29"><b>[60]</b>Ian Perkin</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29"><b>[61]</b>chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce</label> said the double-digit growth in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E21"><b>[63]</b>Hong Kong</label> and <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E32"><b>[65]</b>other Asian countries</label> masked <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E33"><b>[66]</b>their</label> underlying condition . </p>
<p>While <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E34"><b>[67]</b>the region</label> 's growth in exports has been torrid , domestic demand has remained tenuous . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E35"><b>[68]</b>We</label> have n't built up <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E35"><b>[69]</b>our</label> domestic economies yet , '' <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29"><b>[70]</b>he</label> said . </p>
<p>`` The recovery has relied almost completely on export growth . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E28"><b>[71]</b>consumer</label> spending slows down in <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26"><b>[72]</b>the States</label> , it will have a devastating effect on <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[73]</b>Asia</label> , '' said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29"><b>[74]</b>Perkin</label> . </p>
<p>`` 2001 could be a crunch year . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[75]</b>Robinson of the IMF</label> was similarly wary about next year . </p>
<p>In October , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[77]</b>the IMF</label> projected that the <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E5"><b>[78]</b>world</label> economy would grow 4.2 percent in 2001 , while <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[79]</b>Asia as a region</label> would grow 6.6 percent . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[81]</b>Robinson</label> said the growth rate could be lower , though <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[82]</b>he</label> would not say by how much . </p>
<p>A principal culprit of possibly slower growth is the dependence of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E38"><b>[84]</b>many Asian countries</label> on imported oil . </p>
<p>Oil prices have risen $ 5 per barrel since <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[85]</b>the IMF</label> issued <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E48"><b>[86]</b>its</label> semi-annual economic outlook in October . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[87]</b>Asia</label> has little control over oil , but <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[88]</b>Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[89]</b>the region</label> could improve <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[90]</b>its</label> economic prospects by calming <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[91]</b>its</label> political waters . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E39"><b>[92]</b>One bright spot in the Asian landscape</label> is <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E39"><b>[95]</b>China , which is on track to record 8 percent growth in 2000</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[97]</b>Robinson</label> said the main question facing <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E41"><b>[99]</b>Chinese leaders</label> was whether <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E41"><b>[100]</b>they</label> need to spend billions of dollars in public funds to further stimulate an economy that was already expanding . </p>
<p>Like <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E29"><b>[101]</b>Perkin</label> , <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[102]</b>Robinson</label> said <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E1"><b>[103]</b>Asia</label> 's future depended in large part on the health of <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E26"><b>[104]</b>the United States</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[105]</b>he</label> disputed <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E43"><b>[106]</b>those who predict dramatically slowing growth _ the so-called hard landing _ for the American economy</label> . </p>
<p>`` The chances of that happening are less than 40 percent , '' <label class="NYT20001124.2050.0257-E3"><b>[109]</b>he</label> said , `` substantially less . </p>
