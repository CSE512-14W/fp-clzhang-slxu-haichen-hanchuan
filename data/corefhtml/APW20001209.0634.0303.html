<p>France 0027s Chirac Fights EU Deadlock </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E17">NICE , France</label> <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E43">(AP)</label> _ <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E44">One</label> after <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E45">another</label> , late into the night , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">the leaders of Europe</label> filed into <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E48">a small , windowless room</label> for private chats with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">French President Jacques Chirac</label> that could determine the future of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the European Union</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> was fighting to break a deadlock over how to modify <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the 15-nation EU</label> 0027s decision-making mechanisms to cope with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">its</label> planned expansion into <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E1">the former communist East</label> . </p>
<p>On Saturday morning , after <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">he</label> 0027d finished seeing <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">the other 14 EU leaders</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> was scheduled to send <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">them</label> a draft Treaty of Nice _ a blueprint for running <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the bloc of 370 million people</label> as <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">it</label> prepares for <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E4">a dozen new members</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">His</label> efforts , which took place in the midst of a crucial three-day <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">EU</label> summit in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E17">this French resort city</label> , were a step toward the agreement that <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E5">everyone gathered here</label> says is necessary _ but <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E6">nobody</label> thinks will be easy . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E5">Everybody</label> has to be prepared to take a step toward compromise , 00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> told a news conference as <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">he</label> prepared to host the talks . </p>
<p>Failure to find an agreement before the summit ends could push <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the EU</label> into a prolonged crisis and dash the hopes of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E7">Poles</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E8">Hungarians</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E9">Czechs</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E10">others</label> seeking to join <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the EU</label> over the next two or three years . </p>
<p>Painfully aware of the high stakes , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E5">leaders</label> were hopeful an agreement could be reached as the summit , which started Thursday , drags on through the weekend . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E11">I</label> do n0027t want to speculate about failure , 00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E11">Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson</label> told <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E14">reporters</label> after <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E11">his</label> 15-minute meeting with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E11">I</label> do n0027t think that is in the cards . </p>
<p>All political logic tells <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E11">me</label> we 0027ll finally find an agreement over how to distribute power . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> has a particular problem . </p>
<p>As <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">the EU 0027s current chairman</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">he</label> 0027s supposed to broker a compromise . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">he</label> 0027s also defending <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">France</label> 0027s corner in a fight with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">Germany</label> _ the summit 0027s knottiest problem . </p>
<p>Although <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E16">every nation</label> is fighting to maximize <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E16">its</label> voice in <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E3">the reformed union</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E18">other leaders</label> believe summit success hinges on resolving the wrangle between <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">Paris</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">Berlin</label> over <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E19">who controls the most votes in the EU 0027s policy-setting councils</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">Germany , its population swollen to 82 million by reunification</label> , wants <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">its</label> voting weight increased to reflect <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">its</label> position as <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">the EU 0027s biggest nation</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">France</label> says that strikes at the heart of postwar <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">Franco-German</label> parity , which formed the foundation of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E47">Europe</label> 0027s drive for unity . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">Paris</label> defends a status quo that gives <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E15">Germany</label> equal voting rights with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E42">France</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E22">Italy</label> and <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E23">Britain</label> even though <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E24">they</label> each have fewer than <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E25">60 million citizens</label> . </p>
<p>Meanwhile , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E26">smaller nations</label> are struggling to avoid having <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E26">their</label> rights overwhelmed by the maneuvers of <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E27">the `` big four</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 Although no early breakthrough was in sight , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E28">leaders</label> hinted <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E5">the group</label> was edging toward a deal . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E29">I</label> came away reasonably optimistic , 00270027 <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E29">French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin</label> said after one round of talks Thursday . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E5">We</label> ca n0027t say there was movement , but maybe there was a willingness to move . </p>
<p>00270027 Suggestions of compromise appeared on the contentious issue of how many seats <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E36">each nation</label> has on <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E31">the EU 0027s executive body</label> , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E31">the European Commission</label> . </p>
<p>To prevent <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E31">the Commission</label> from becoming top-heavy after the expansion , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E33">bigger nations</label> have agreed to give up <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E33">their</label> second seat , so <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E34">all</label> will have one each . </p>
<p>Plans to go beyond that , to introduce a rotation where <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E35">some</label> would be temporarily without a seat , were likely to be shelved . </p>
<p>A compromise also seemed likely on another central issue _ replacing unanimous voting with majority decisions on a number of issues , including transport and environmental protection . </p>
<p>But unanimous decisions were expected to remain the rule on the most sensitive topics , such as taxation , immigration and social security . </p>
<p>Despite the guarded confidence , <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">the leaders</label> were aware that hours _ possibly days _ of grueling negotiations were likely still ahead of them after <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">they</label> receive <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E49">Chirac</label> 0027s treaty draft with <label class="APW20001209.0634.0303-E46">their</label> breakfast croissants Saturday . </p>
