<p>It 0027s the first foreign policy spat of an otherwise domestically focused <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E22">presidential</label> campaign between <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E73">two candidates who have sharply different views of America 0027s role in the world</label> and a wide gap in foreign policy experience . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">Russians</label> must use <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">their</label> leverage on <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">Mr. Milosevic</label> to make sure <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">he</label> ... finally leaves , 00270027 <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> said Friday in <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E2">Cedar Rapids , Iowa</label> , repeating what <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">he</label> said in Tuesday 0027s first <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E22">presidential</label> debate . </p>
<p>As <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">he</label> spoke , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E4">Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov</label> was in <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E69">Yugoslavia</label> , meeting with <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">ousted leader Slobodan Milosevic</label> and recognizing <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E6">opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica</label> as <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E6">winner of the Sept. 24 election</label> . </p>
<p>In the debate , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> jumped on <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> , dismissing <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">his</label> idea of bringing in <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">the Russians</label> as unwise because <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">they</label> had n0027t recognized <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E6">Kostunica</label> as <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E6">victor</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">I</label> 0027m not sure that it 0027s right for <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E8">us</label> to invite <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E7">the president of Russia</label> to mediate this dispute <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E69">there</label> , because <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E8">we</label> might not like the result that comes out of that , 00270027 <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> said . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> criticized <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">his opponent</label> 0027s statement . </p>

<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E10">Gore campaign aides</label> insisted <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">he</label> was aware of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E13">administration</label> efforts to persuade <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">the Russians</label> to convince <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">Milosevic</label> to go . </p>
<p>In Thursday night 0027s <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E59">vice presidential</label> debate , as <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E15">Kostunica supporters</label> stormed <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E16">Belgrade</label> to drive out <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">Milosevic</label> , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E17">Republican Dick Cheney</label> said <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> had been `` pooh-poohing 00270027 the idea of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">Russian</label> involvement while <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E13">the administration</label> was doing just about what <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> had proposed . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E17">Cheney</label> said <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> deserved `` a lot of credit for that . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E20">Marc Thiessen</label> , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E20">spokesman for the GOP-controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee</label> , said <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E25">administration officials</label> told <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E26">members of Congress</label> in a briefing Wednesday that <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E53">Clinton</label> sent a letter to <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E7">Russian President Vladimir Putin</label> three weeks ago `` asking <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E7">him</label> to step in and do exactly what <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> suggested 00270027 and on Saturday personally urged <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E7">Putin</label> by phone to intervene . </p>
<p>`` It was <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush who was completely informed , whose instincts were right</label> , and it was <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore who was uninformed and did n0027t even know the administration policy</label> , 00270027 <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E20">Thiessen</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> on Friday welcomed <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E69">Yugoslavia</label> 0027s change , saying it brings <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E69">the country</label> `` back into <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E60">the community of nations</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">He</label> added , `` This is a day for celebration , 00270027 without commenting on the <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">Russian</label> issue . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E30">The White House</label> , however , came to <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">his</label> defense . </p>
<p>`` What <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">the vice president</label> said is something <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E53">the president</label> fully agrees with , which is that <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E8">the United States</label> did not support any role in which <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E66">Russia</label> would mediate between <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E1">Milosevic</label> and <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E6">Kostunica</label> , 00270027 said <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E31">presidential spokesman Jake Siewert , who confirmed that Clinton spoke with Putin about Yugoslavia last weekend</label> . </p>
<p>The dispute over a foreign policy matter comes late in a campaign that has given little attention to most offshore issues . </p>
<p>What discussion there has been has tended to involve a contrast in plans for <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E33">the military</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Bush</label> decries the state of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E33">the military</label> and calls for more-limited engagement <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E61">abroad</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> defends current <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E33">military</label> readiness and urges a definition of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E8">national</label> security interests that would include environmental , health and other <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E62">global</label> issues . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E73">The candidates</label> also have differences on <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E35">missile</label> defense , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E36">nuclear arms</label> cuts , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E62">global</label> warming , immigration and trade , but none of those issues has turned into a major debate . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">Gore</label> has been active in foreign affairs as <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E11">vice president</label> , serving on <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E38">commissions with key countries , including one with former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E42">Bush 0027s supporters</label> say that despite <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">his</label> lack of direct foreign policy experience , <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">his</label> record as <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">Texas governor</label> , including dealings with <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E45">neighbor Mexico</label> , show <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E43">he</label> 0027ll inspire the trust of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E47">allies</label> and the respect of <label class="APW20001007.0339.0149-E48">adversaries</label> . </p>
