<p>CANADIAN MUTUAL FUND COMPANY WITHDRAWS BID FOR LARGER RIVAL </p>
<p>& UR ; By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E19"><b>[0]</b>TORONTO</label> _ Unwilling to fight a counterbid that so far is only speculation , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[1]</b>C.I. Fund Management Inc.</label> has scrapped a $ 2.5 billion hostile takeover attempt of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[2]</b>a larger rival</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[3]</b>the Mackenzie Financial Corp.</label> , along with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[4]</b>its</label> hope of combining <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E42"><b>[6]</b>the two Toronto companies</label> to form <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E44"><b>[8]</b>Canada 's largest mutual-fund empire</label> . </p>
<p>Although <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[9]</b>C.I. Fund</label> 's cash-and-stock offer , made six weeks ago , was almost 40 percent higher than the price of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[10]</b>Mackenzie</label> shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E46"><b>[12]</b>Mackenzie management</label> quickly branded the offer `` opportunistic '' and activated a poison pill , a strategy that makes a hostile bid prohibitively expensive , to give it more time to find <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E47"><b>[13]</b>other buyers</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[14]</b>Mackenzie</label> also told <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E48"><b>[16]</b>its 1,400 employees</label> that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E1"><b>[17]</b>anyone who was fired by a new owner</label> would receive a year 's salary . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[20]</b>C.I. Fund</label> was not helped in <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[21]</b>its</label> quest by <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[22]</b>another small fund company</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[23]</b>AIC Ltd. of Burlington , Ontario , which owns 24.5 percent of Mackenzie 's shares</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[28]</b>AIC</label> agreed that the <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[29]</b>C.I. Fund</label> offer was inadequate . </p>
<p>And industry sources suggested that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[30]</b>AIC</label> would make a counterbid , perhaps with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8"><b>[31]</b>the powerful Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8"><b>[32]</b>a $ 60 billion pension fund that already owns 5 percent of Mackenzie 's shares</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E11"><b>[35]</b>Investors Group of Winnipeg , Manitoba</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E11"><b>[39]</b>Canada 's largest mutual-fund manager</label> , and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E15"><b>[40]</b>the American Express Co. of New York</label> were also talked about as <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E38"><b>[42]</b>possible bidders</label> . </p>
<p>As the weeks went by , however , no rival bid emerged . </p>
<p>After extending the expiration date on <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[43]</b>its</label> offer to 35 days from 21 , a period that brought no new developments , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[44]</b>C.I. Fund</label> requested a hearing before <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17"><b>[45]</b>the Ontario Securities Commission</label> earlier this week . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[46]</b>It</label> wanted <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17"><b>[47]</b>the commission</label> to dissolve <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[48]</b>Mackenzie</label> 's poison pill , arguing that it interfered with the rights of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E18"><b>[50]</b>Mackenzie 's shareholders</label> . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , the day before the hearing , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[51]</b>AIC</label> said publicly that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[52]</b>it</label> was `` evaluating '' a bid for <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[53]</b>MacKenzie</label> along with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8"><b>[54]</b>the Caisse de Depot</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[55]</b>It</label> said <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[56]</b>its</label> friendly offer would be higher and would include more than the $ 400 million in cash that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[57]</b>C.I. Fund</label> had offered . </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[58]</b>C.I. Fund</label> withdrew <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[59]</b>its</label> request for the <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17"><b>[60]</b>commission</label> hearing and on Thursday night <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[61]</b>its</label> offer died when the deadline for acceptance expired . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E21"><b>[62]</b>William Holland</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E21"><b>[64]</b>C.I. Fund 's chief executive</label> , said <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[66]</b>his company</label> withdrew because <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[67]</b>its</label> first offer was the best <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7"><b>[68]</b>it</label> could make . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40"><b>[69]</b>Mackenzie</label> is almost certain to be sold over the next few weeks , and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[70]</b>AIC</label> is <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3"><b>[71]</b>the most likely buyer</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E23"><b>[72]</b>James Hunter</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E23"><b>[74]</b>Mackenzie 's chief executive</label> , said there were still <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E25"><b>[75]</b>several possible buyers</label> and the process of finding the best price continued . </p>
<p>Over the last two years , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E26"><b>[76]</b>the number of fund managers in Canada</label> has been trimmed by half a dozen takeovers . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E27"><b>[78]</b>Smaller firms , squeezed by comparatively high overheads</label> , have been the most vulnerable . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E28"><b>[79]</b>larger companies</label> have also been put on the block as <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E28"><b>[80]</b>their</label> <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E30"><b>[81]</b>founders</label> and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E31"><b>[82]</b>controlling shareholders</label> near retirement age . </p>
<p>Most of the consolidation has involved <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E32"><b>[84]</b>domestic companies</label> . </p>
<p>But the largest takeover so far was by <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E34"><b>[85]</b>Amvescap PLC of London , which in May paid $ 1.8 billion for Canada 's sixth-largest fund company , the Trimark Financial Corp. of Toronto</label> . </p>
