<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E19">TORONTO</label> _ Unwilling to fight a counterbid that so far is only speculation , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund Management Inc.</label> has scrapped a $ 2.5 billion hostile takeover attempt of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">a larger rival</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">the Mackenzie Financial Corp.</label> , along with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> hope of combining <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E42">the two Toronto companies</label> to form <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E44">Canada 0027s largest mutual-fund empire</label> . </p>
<p>Although <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> 0027s cash-and-stock offer , made six weeks ago , was almost 40 percent higher than the price of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">Mackenzie</label> shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E46">Mackenzie management</label> quickly branded the offer `` opportunistic 00270027 and activated a poison pill , a strategy that makes a hostile bid prohibitively expensive , to give it more time to find <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E47">other buyers</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">Mackenzie</label> also told <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E48">its 1,400 employees</label> that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E1">anyone who was fired by a new owner</label> would receive a year 0027s salary . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> was not helped in <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> quest by <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">another small fund company</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">AIC Ltd. of Burlington , Ontario , which owns 24.5 percent of Mackenzie 0027s shares</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">AIC</label> agreed that the <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> offer was inadequate . </p>
<p>And industry sources suggested that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">AIC</label> would make a counterbid , perhaps with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8">the powerful Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8">a $ 60 billion pension fund that already owns 5 percent of Mackenzie 0027s shares</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E11">Investors Group of Winnipeg , Manitoba</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E11">Canada 0027s largest mutual-fund manager</label> , and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E15">the American Express Co. of New York</label> were also talked about as <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E38">possible bidders</label> . </p>
<p>As the weeks went by , however , no rival bid emerged . </p>
<p>After extending the expiration date on <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> offer to 35 days from 21 , a period that brought no new developments , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> requested a hearing before <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17">the Ontario Securities Commission</label> earlier this week . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">It</label> wanted <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17">the commission</label> to dissolve <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">Mackenzie</label> 0027s poison pill , arguing that it interfered with the rights of <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E18">Mackenzie 0027s shareholders</label> . </p>
<p>On Tuesday , the day before the hearing , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">AIC</label> said publicly that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">it</label> was `` evaluating 00270027 a bid for <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">MacKenzie</label> along with <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E8">the Caisse de Depot</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">It</label> said <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">its</label> friendly offer would be higher and would include more than the $ 400 million in cash that <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> had offered . </p>
<p>On Wednesday morning , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">C.I. Fund</label> withdrew <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> request for the <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E17">commission</label> hearing and on Thursday night <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> offer died when the deadline for acceptance expired . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E21">William Holland</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E21">C.I. Fund 0027s chief executive</label> , said <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">his company</label> withdrew because <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">its</label> first offer was the best <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E7">it</label> could make . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E40">Mackenzie</label> is almost certain to be sold over the next few weeks , and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">AIC</label> is <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E3">the most likely buyer</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E23">James Hunter</label> , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E23">Mackenzie 0027s chief executive</label> , said there were still <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E25">several possible buyers</label> and the process of finding the best price continued . </p>
<p>Over the last two years , <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E26">the number of fund managers in Canada</label> has been trimmed by half a dozen takeovers . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E27">Smaller firms , squeezed by comparatively high overheads</label> , have been the most vulnerable . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E28">larger companies</label> have also been put on the block as <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E28">their</label> <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E30">founders</label> and <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E31">controlling shareholders</label> near retirement age . </p>
<p>Most of the consolidation has involved <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E32">domestic companies</label> . </p>
<p>But the largest takeover so far was by <label class="NYT20001222.2029.0326-E34">Amvescap PLC of London , which in May paid $ 1.8 billion for Canada 0027s sixth-largest fund company , the Trimark Financial Corp. of Toronto</label> . </p>
