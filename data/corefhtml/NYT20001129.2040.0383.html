<p><label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E20"><b>[0]</b>TALLAHASSEE , Fla.</label> _ <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[1]</b>Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore</label> said Wednesday <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[2]</b>their</label> only chance for victory in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[3]</b>his</label> contest of the <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E38"><b>[4]</b>Florida</label> election would be shattered if <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[5]</b>they</label> have to wait until Saturday to begin counting disputed ballots , and <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[6]</b>they</label> began an appeal to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[7]</b>the Florida Supreme Court</label> to do the counting <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[8]</b>itself</label> , immediately . </p>
<p>The appeal was filed with <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E40"><b>[9]</b>the District Court of Appeal</label> late Wednesday afternoon , and will be submitted to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[10]</b>the state 's highest court</label> early Thursday , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[11]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> said . </p>
<p>It essentially asks <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[12]</b>the Supreme Court</label> to take over <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[13]</b>Gore</label> 's contest lawsuit from <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E42"><b>[14]</b>the slow-moving trial court</label> , to count the ballots <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[15]</b>itself</label> , and eventually to declare <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[16]</b>Gore</label> <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E1"><b>[17]</b>the winner</label> if <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[18]</b>he</label> wins the recount . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E2"><b>[19]</b>lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush</label> said <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E2"><b>[20]</b>they</label> had no intention of allowing any hand counting to begin without a vigorous legal fight . </p>
<p>To that end , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E2"><b>[21]</b>they</label> persuaded <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E5"><b>[22]</b>Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls</label> to order 1.1 million ballots _ every vote cast in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E7"><b>[23]</b>Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties</label> _ brought up from <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E10"><b>[24]</b>south Florida</label> and placed in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[25]</b>the court</label> 's custody . </p>
<p>That represents 83 times the number of disputed ballots that <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E11"><b>[26]</b>the judge</label> had agreed on Tuesday to transport to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E20"><b>[27]</b>Tallahassee</label> at <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E12"><b>[28]</b>the Gore team</label> 's request . </p>
<p>And it could take weeks if not months to count them all , the point that <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E14"><b>[29]</b>Barry Richard</label> , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E14"><b>[30]</b>Bush 's chief trial lawyer here</label> , said <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E14"><b>[31]</b>he</label> was trying to make in requesting that the ballots be transported <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E20"><b>[32]</b>here</label> . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E16"><b>[33]</b>We</label> did it to make a point , '' <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E14"><b>[34]</b>Richard</label> said in an interview . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E17"><b>[35]</b>you</label> recount any ballots , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E17"><b>[36]</b>you</label> have to recount all of them . </p>
<p>Now , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E16"><b>[37]</b>we</label> do n't think any ballots should be counted , because the manual recount of ballots is finished . </p>
<p>But in the event <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[38]</b>the court</label> determines that some ballots should be counted , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E16"><b>[39]</b>we</label> wanted them <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E20"><b>[40]</b>here</label> so they could all be counted . </p>
<p>'' Aware that <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[41]</b>they</label> could not stop the movement of all the ballots , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[42]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> barely objected to the move , asking only that the disputed ballots that might contain hidden <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[43]</b>Gore</label> votes be separated from the mass. `` <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E18"><b>[44]</b>I</label> know when it 's futile , '' said <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E18"><b>[45]</b>David Boies</label> , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E18"><b>[46]</b>Gore 's chief trial lawyer</label> , to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E5"><b>[47]</b>Sauls</label> . </p>
<p>Nonetheless , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[48]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> were furious at the move , aware that it represents yet another enormous barrier to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[49]</b>their</label> hopes for an immediate count of the 14,000 disputed ballots in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E7"><b>[50]</b>the two counties</label> and a quick decision from <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E21"><b>[51]</b>the judge</label> that <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[52]</b>Gore</label> really won the election . </p>
<p>Even if <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[53]</b>the Florida Supreme Court</label> should swiftly agree to <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[54]</b>their</label> request and orders the counting to begin by Friday , that would still put <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[55]</b>them</label> three days behind <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[56]</b>their</label> original timetable . </p>
<p>And facing a Dec. 12 deadline for <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E38"><b>[57]</b>the state</label> to name <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E22"><b>[58]</b>electors for the Electoral College</label> , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E13"><b>[59]</b>Gore</label> has absolutely no days to spare . </p>
<p>`` It 's a stunt , '' said <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E24"><b>[60]</b>Kendall Coffey</label> , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E24"><b>[61]</b>one of Gore 's election lawyers</label> , as <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E24"><b>[62]</b>he</label> stormed out of <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E34"><b>[63]</b>Sauls ' courtroom</label> Wednesday , referring to the request for all the ballots . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E27"><b>[64]</b>They</label> 're trying to bog down the case , the system , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E28"><b>[65]</b>the clerk 's office</label> and everywhere else <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E27"><b>[66]</b>they</label> can . </p>
<p>'' The decision by <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[67]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> to appeal the case shows how perilous <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[68]</b>their</label> situation is . </p>
<p>By appealing , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[69]</b>the lawyers</label> were forced to put on paper <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[70]</b>their</label> fear that <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[71]</b>their</label> case could be over if <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[72]</b>they</label> cannot begin counting ballots until Saturday . </p>
<p>The decision to wait until a Saturday hearing `` is effectively a final order denying all relief sought by <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E30"><b>[73]</b>plaintiffs</label> because the action now pending below must be completed before Dec. 12 , 2000 , in order to offer any relief , '' said the notice filed with <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E40"><b>[74]</b>the Court of Appeal</label> . </p>
<p>It adds , `` <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E40"><b>[75]</b>the court</label> must allow sufficient time to complete an accurate and fair count of the contested ballots , which is essential for the proper resolution of the contest action . </p>
<p>'' But the decision to bring up all the ballots means that they will not be assembled in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E20"><b>[76]</b>Tallahassee</label> until late Friday , a day later than planned . </p>
<p>And even then , the hurdles are enormous . </p>
<p>There will have to be another hearing before <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[77]</b>the Florida Supreme Court</label> , and <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E35"><b>[78]</b>Gore 's lawyers</label> will have to refute three arguments to be raised by <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E31"><b>[79]</b>the Bush team</label> : There should be no more counting at all ; if there is any counting , it will have to include all 1.16 million ballots ; and if there is any counting of disputed ballots , dimples cannot be counted as votes . </p>
<p>If these issues are heard before <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E5"><b>[80]</b>Sanders</label> , there will have to be briefs , <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E33"><b>[81]</b>witnesses</label> , and evidence on each point , which could take days . </p>
<p>If <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[82]</b>the Supreme Court</label> agrees to short-circuit the process , there will still have to be lengthy briefs filed , and <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[83]</b>the court</label> may need to wait several days before finding time for yet another momentous hearing in <label class="NYT20001129.2040.0383-E39"><b>[84]</b>its</label> schedule . </p>
