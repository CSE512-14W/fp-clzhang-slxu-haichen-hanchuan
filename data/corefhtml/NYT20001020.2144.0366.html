<p>UNDATED : he added . </p>
<p>& LR ; & HT ; As with credit insurance , internal documents from Associates suggest that employees have been pressured to encourage homeowners and other borrowers to refinance loans ; the emphasis was usually on how this would benefit the company , not on how it might help the customer . </p>
<p>In the `` Roadmap '' memo , for example , a chart showed how the profitability of a <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E13"><b>[0]</b>consumer</label> loan decreases as it ages . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E15"><b>[1]</b>You</label> can see how the earnings decline over time , '' the memo said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E16"><b>[2]</b>Your controller</label> can provide lists to <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E15"><b>[3]</b>you</label> of aged personal loans to target for renewal . </p>
<p>'' Another memo , sent in 1991 to `` <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E17"><b>[4]</b>all branch managers</label> , '' concerned <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E19"><b>[5]</b>Associates</label> ' practice of acquiring <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E13"><b>[6]</b>consumer</label> loans made by <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E20"><b>[7]</b>other lenders or retailers</label> . </p>
<p>`` The principal reason <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E19"><b>[8]</b>we</label> purchase an acquisition is to convert it to a more profitable loan , '' the memo stated . </p>
<p>`` If <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E19"><b>[9]</b>we</label> cannot convert acquisitions , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E19"><b>[10]</b>we</label> cannot continue to purchase them . </p>
<p>'' The memo then stipulated that <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E21"><b>[11]</b>employees who renewed such loans , if secured by real estate</label> , would receive a $ 100 bonus for each loan . </p>
<p>Last month , in an <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E23"><b>[12]</b>investor</label> conference call , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E1"><b>[13]</b>Keith W. Hughes</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E1"><b>[14]</b>the chief executive of Associates , who will join Citigroup as a vice chairman after the merger</label> , cited the strong cultural similarities between <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E4"><b>[15]</b>the companies</label> . </p>
<p>But in an interview last week , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[16]</b>Marge Magner</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[17]</b>a Citigroup executive who previously oversaw Citigroup 's consumer finance business</label> , stressed what <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[18]</b>she</label> said were big differences , particularly in how <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E10"><b>[19]</b>the sales staff</label> is paid . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E19"><b>[20]</b>Associates</label> bases pay on the volume of loans that <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E11"><b>[21]</b>employees</label> generate , a `` count <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E14"><b>[22]</b>your</label> transactions '' approach , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[23]</b>Magner</label> said . </p>
<p>At <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[24]</b>Citifinancial</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[25]</b>she</label> said , `` <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[26]</b>we</label> deal with <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[27]</b>the business as a whole</label> , <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[28]</b>the whole branch</label> and how it 's growing . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[29]</b>She</label> also emphasized that the <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[30]</b>Citifinancial</label> computer system used by <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E10"><b>[31]</b>the sales staff</label> automatically rejected products and interest rate levels that did not seem suitable for <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E12"><b>[32]</b>a specific customer</label> , giving <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E8"><b>[33]</b>Citifinancial</label> a measure of centralized control over lending practices . </p>
<p>`` A lot of the compliance issues are built into the system , '' <label class="NYT20001020.2144.0366-E5"><b>[34]</b>she</label> said . </p>
