<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E22"><b>[8]</b>The court</label> , on a 6-3 vote Monday , declined to hear <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[9]</b>Northwest</label> 's appeal that argued the lawsuit was pre-empted by the federal law that deregulated <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E26"><b>[10]</b>the airline industry</label> . </p>
<p>Voting to grant review were <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E27"><b>[11]</b>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label> and <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E19"><b>[12]</b>Justices</label> <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E31"><b>[13]</b>Sandra Day O 'Connor</label> and <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E20"><b>[14]</b>Clarence Thomas</label> . </p>
<p>Writing for <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E30"><b>[15]</b>the three</label> , <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E31"><b>[16]</b>O 'Connor</label> said the case `` presents an important issue '' that has divided <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E32"><b>[17]</b>federal appeals courts</label> and should be resolved by <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E22"><b>[18]</b>the nation 's highest court</label> . </p>
<p>The case was filed by <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E2"><b>[19]</b>Julie Duncan of Seattle , who said she suffered lung problems and chronic infections apparently related to secondhand smoke</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[20]</b>Northwest</label> prohibited smoking on domestic flights in 1988 , before the ban was required by federal law , but continued to allow smoking on flights to and from <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E4"><b>[21]</b>Japan</label> for another decade . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[22]</b>The airline</label> said <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[23]</b>it</label> did so to compete with <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E5"><b>[24]</b>other airlines that let passengers smoke</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E2"><b>[25]</b>Duncan</label> 's lawsuit , which sought class-action status , said <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[26]</b>Northwest</label> violated <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[27]</b>its</label> duty under <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E7"><b>[28]</b>Washington</label> <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E8"><b>[29]</b>state</label> law to provide a safe and healthy working environment . </p>
<p>The 1978 Airline Deregulation Act pre-empts all <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E8"><b>[30]</b>state</label> lawsuits related to <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[31]</b>airline</label> rates , routes or services . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E10"><b>[32]</b>A federal judge</label> dismissed the lawsuit , saying that allowing <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E2"><b>[33]</b>Duncan</label> 's claim to proceed would amount to allowing <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E8"><b>[34]</b>state</label> regulation of a `` service '' provided by <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[35]</b>Northwest</label> on <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[36]</b>its</label> <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E11"><b>[37]</b>trans-Pacific</label> flights . </p>
<p>But <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E12"><b>[38]</b>the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals</label> reinstated <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E2"><b>[39]</b>Duncan</label> 's lawsuit last April . </p>
<p>Allowing smoking on some flights is not a `` service '' provided by <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[40]</b>an airline</label> , <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E12"><b>[41]</b>the court</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E12"><b>[42]</b>The court</label> also said the prospect of damages from a personal-injury lawsuit would not affect <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[43]</b>an airline</label> 's services enough to warrant pre-emption under the federal law . </p>
<p>In the appeal acted on Monday , <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E14"><b>[44]</b>Northwest 's lawyers</label> said <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[45]</b>airlines</label> should not have to `` tailor <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[46]</b>their</label> operations '' to comply with laws in <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E15"><b>[47]</b>various states</label> . </p>
<p><label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E16"><b>[48]</b>Duncan 's lawyers</label> said the deregulation law was not intended to protect <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E9"><b>[49]</b>airlines</label> from personal-injury claims . </p>
<p>The case is <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E24"><b>[50]</b>Northwest Airlines</label> v. <label class="APW20001211.1441.0436-E2"><b>[51]</b>Duncan</label> , 00-404 . </p>
