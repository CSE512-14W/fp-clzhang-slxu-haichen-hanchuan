<p>WHEN A DIME MATTERS : LEVITT GOES AFTER OPTION MARKETS </p>
<p>& UR ; By FLOYD NORRIS & LR ; & QC ; & QL ; & UR ; c. 2000 N.Y. Times News Service & QC ; & LR ; & QL ; </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[0]</b>Arthur Levitt</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[1]</b>the longest-serving chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission</label> , is at it again . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[2]</b>He</label> 's angry about ways in which <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E37"><b>[3]</b>individual investors</label> are badly treated , and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[4]</b>he</label> wants to do something about it . </p>
<p>On Friday , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[5]</b>Levitt</label> will disclose what may be the final initiatives of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[6]</b>his</label> term . </p>
<p>Evidently unconcerned that follow-up will fall to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E38"><b>[7]</b>an SEC chairman named by the next president</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[8]</b>he</label> is putting pressure on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E41"><b>[9]</b>supposedly independent directors of mutual funds</label> to hold down the commissions <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E42"><b>[10]</b>the funds</label> spend when <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E42"><b>[11]</b>they</label> trade stocks , and on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E43"><b>[12]</b>corporate audit committees</label> to do a better job . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[13]</b>He</label> is threatening <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36"><b>[14]</b>SEC</label> action if <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E1"><b>[15]</b>companies</label> continue to issue new stock options to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E2"><b>[16]</b>top executives</label> without getting <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E3"><b>[17]</b>shareholder</label> approval . </p>
<p>Most important , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[18]</b>Levitt</label> is demanding that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4"><b>[19]</b>the options industry</label> put systems in place within a year to allow <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E5"><b>[20]</b>its customers</label> to experience the benefits of decimalization by trading in penny increments . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36"><b>[21]</b>The commission</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[22]</b>Levitt</label> said in remarks prepared for a speech at <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E6"><b>[23]</b>Fordham University</label> on Friday , should `` press <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E7"><b>[24]</b>the markets</label> hard '' to do that . </p>
<p>To understand <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[25]</b>his</label> concern , consider trading Thursday in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8"><b>[26]</b>Compaq Computer</label> securities . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8"><b>[27]</b>Compaq</label> stock was trading with a spread of 4 cents between the best bid and the best asked price . </p>
<p>At the same time , the most actively traded option contract on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8"><b>[28]</b>Compaq</label> had a spread of 40 cents , 10 times as wide . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E9"><b>[29]</b>The options exchanges</label> ' rules bar any price change of less than a dime , while the stock price can move by a penny . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E10"><b>[30]</b>Investors</label> are being denied the benefits of lower spreads , '' <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[31]</b>Levitt</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4"><b>[32]</b>The industry</label> is keeping the difference for <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4"><b>[33]</b>itself</label> . </p>
<p>'' The history of competition in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E7"><b>[34]</b>the options markets</label> is not a pretty one . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E9"><b>[35]</b>The exchanges</label> avoided real competition for years , and then began to compete on the basis of kicking back money _ the polite term is `` payment for order flow '' _ to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E11"><b>[36]</b>brokers who send in customer orders</label> . </p>
<p>Maybe such kickbacks lower commissions charged to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E12"><b>[37]</b>customers</label> , but that is hard to prove . </p>
<p>What is clear is that the current system discourages price competition that would really help <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E12"><b>[38]</b>customers</label> . </p>
<p>Going to pennies would strain computer systems , but little has been done to get systems that could cope . </p>
<p>In an interview , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14"><b>[39]</b>Edward Joyce</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14"><b>[40]</b>the president of the Chicago Board Options Exchange</label> , said <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4"><b>[41]</b>the industry</label> was `` just acting prudently '' by going slowly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14"><b>[42]</b>He</label> gave no timetable for change . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[43]</b>Levitt</label> 's term as <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[44]</b>SEC chairman</label> included the reform of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E18"><b>[45]</b>the Nasdaq market</label> , action on abuses in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E20"><b>[46]</b>the municipal bond market</label> and the new regulation to bar selective <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E44"><b>[47]</b>corporate</label> disclosures . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[48]</b>He</label> 's done extraordinarily well , '' said <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22"><b>[49]</b>Joel Seligman</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22"><b>[50]</b>the dean of the Washington University law school</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22"><b>[51]</b>author of a history of the SEC</label> . </p>
<p>`` On <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E18"><b>[52]</b>Nasdaq</label> and other issues , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[53]</b>he</label> pursued a principled approach consistent with the goals of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E26"><b>[54]</b>investor</label> protection . </p>
<p>'' Sometime before <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[55]</b>his</label> term ends , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36"><b>[56]</b>the SEC</label> is likely to approve rules that will limit the amount of consulting services <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E27"><b>[57]</b>auditors</label> can provide for <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E28"><b>[58]</b>their audit clients</label> . </p>
<p>On options or accounting or most anything else , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E29"><b>[59]</b>a new SEC</label> could reverse <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[60]</b>Levitt</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36"><b>[61]</b>the current SEC</label> . </p>
<p>There is precedent for that . </p>
<p>Just over 20 years ago , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36"><b>[62]</b>the SEC</label> approved a rule that forced <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E27"><b>[63]</b>auditors</label> to disclose consulting arrangements with <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E28"><b>[64]</b>clients</label> . </p>
<p>Then <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E30"><b>[65]</b>Ronald Reagan</label> won the election , and the rule was quietly repealed . </p>
<p>By acting now , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[66]</b>Levitt</label> is making such moves more difficult . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[67]</b>I</label> want to be certain , '' <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17"><b>[68]</b>he</label> said in an interview Thursday , `` that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E31"><b>[69]</b>my successors</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E31"><b>[70]</b>their successors</label> do not forget the commitment to the primacy of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E37"><b>[71]</b>the individual investor</label> as being central to the success of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E34"><b>[72]</b>our markets</label> . </p>
