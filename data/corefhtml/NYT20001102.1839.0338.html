<p>Evidently unconcerned that follow-up will fall to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E38">an SEC chairman named by the next president</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">he</label> is putting pressure on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E41">supposedly independent directors of mutual funds</label> to hold down the commissions <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E42">the funds</label> spend when <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E42">they</label> trade stocks , and on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E43">corporate audit committees</label> to do a better job . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">He</label> is threatening <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36">SEC</label> action if <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E1">companies</label> continue to issue new stock options to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E2">top executives</label> without getting <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E3">shareholder</label> approval . </p>
<p>Most important , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> is demanding that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4">the options industry</label> put systems in place within a year to allow <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E5">its customers</label> to experience the benefits of decimalization by trading in penny increments . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36">The commission</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> said in remarks prepared for a speech at <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E6">Fordham University</label> on Friday , should `` press <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E7">the markets</label> hard 00270027 to do that . </p>
<p>To understand <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">his</label> concern , consider trading Thursday in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8">Compaq Computer</label> securities . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8">Compaq</label> stock was trading with a spread of 4 cents between the best bid and the best asked price . </p>
<p>At the same time , the most actively traded option contract on <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E8">Compaq</label> had a spread of 40 cents , 10 times as wide . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E9">The options exchanges</label> 0027 rules bar any price change of less than a dime , while the stock price can move by a penny . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E10">Investors</label> are being denied the benefits of lower spreads , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> said . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4">The industry</label> is keeping the difference for <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4">itself</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 The history of competition in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E7">the options markets</label> is not a pretty one . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E9">The exchanges</label> avoided real competition for years , and then began to compete on the basis of kicking back money _ the polite term is `` payment for order flow 00270027 _ to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E11">brokers who send in customer orders</label> . </p>
<p>Maybe such kickbacks lower commissions charged to <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E12">customers</label> , but that is hard to prove . </p>
<p>What is clear is that the current system discourages price competition that would really help <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E12">customers</label> . </p>
<p>Going to pennies would strain computer systems , but little has been done to get systems that could cope . </p>
<p>In an interview , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14">Edward Joyce</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14">the president of the Chicago Board Options Exchange</label> , said <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E4">the industry</label> was `` just acting prudently 00270027 by going slowly . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E14">He</label> gave no timetable for change . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> 0027s term as <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">SEC chairman</label> included the reform of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E18">the Nasdaq market</label> , action on abuses in <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E20">the municipal bond market</label> and the new regulation to bar selective <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E44">corporate</label> disclosures . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">He</label> 0027s done extraordinarily well , 00270027 said <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22">Joel Seligman</label> , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22">the dean of the Washington University law school</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E22">author of a history of the SEC</label> . </p>
<p>`` On <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E18">Nasdaq</label> and other issues , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">he</label> pursued a principled approach consistent with the goals of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E26">investor</label> protection . </p>
<p>00270027 Sometime before <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">his</label> term ends , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36">the SEC</label> is likely to approve rules that will limit the amount of consulting services <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E27">auditors</label> can provide for <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E28">their audit clients</label> . </p>
<p>On options or accounting or most anything else , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E29">a new SEC</label> could reverse <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36">the current SEC</label> . </p>
<p>There is precedent for that . </p>
<p>Just over 20 years ago , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E36">the SEC</label> approved a rule that forced <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E27">auditors</label> to disclose consulting arrangements with <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E28">clients</label> . </p>
<p>Then <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E30">Ronald Reagan</label> won the election , and the rule was quietly repealed . </p>
<p>By acting now , <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">Levitt</label> is making such moves more difficult . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">I</label> want to be certain , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E17">he</label> said in an interview Thursday , `` that <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E31">my successors</label> and <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E31">their successors</label> do not forget the commitment to the primacy of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E37">the individual investor</label> as being central to the success of <label class="NYT20001102.1839.0338-E34">our markets</label> . </p>
