<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E23"><b>[0]</b>WASHINGTON</label> _ <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[1]</b>Vice President Al Gore</label> 's nationwide lead in the popular vote has grown by about 200,000 , to more than half a million , since Dec. 18 , when <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E15"><b>[2]</b>the Electoral College</label> sealed <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[3]</b>his</label> fate and made <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[4]</b>Gov. George W. Bush</label> <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[5]</b>the 43rd president of the United States</label> . </p>
<p>A <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E54"><b>[6]</b>state-by-state</label> survey by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E56"><b>[7]</b>The Associated Press</label> of the final certified results put <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[8]</b>Gore</label> 's popular-vote edge at 539,947 , up considerably from the lead of about 337,000 that was widely reported in the first several weeks after the election . </p>
<p>The totals were 50,996,116 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[9]</b>Gore</label> and 50,456,169 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[10]</b>Bush</label> . </p>
<p>Much of the increase came in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42"><b>[11]</b>California</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1"><b>[12]</b>New York</label> , and <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E2"><b>[13]</b>other , smaller states that went for Gore</label> , said <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3"><b>[14]</b>Curtis B. Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate , a nonpartisan research group that has followed presidential elections for a quarter-century</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E6"><b>[15]</b>Election officials in California and New York</label> said Friday that the bigger numbers for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[16]</b>Gore</label> were not hard to explain . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[17]</b>Gore</label> carried <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E7"><b>[18]</b>both big states</label> easily . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E7"><b>[19]</b>Both states</label> had big <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[20]</b>absentee-ballot</label> totals that could not be counted immediately and , because <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[21]</b>absentee</label> votes generally do not vary sharply from Election Night returns , it was predictable that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[22]</b>the absentees</label> would widen <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[23]</b>the vice president</label> 's lead . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3"><b>[24]</b>Gans</label> said that in 1996 , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E10"><b>[25]</b>President Clinton</label> 's lead over <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E12"><b>[26]</b>Bob Dole</label> grew by some 200,000 votes from election night until all <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[27]</b>absentee</label> ballots were counted and all the votes certified , a fact all but forgotten except by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E14"><b>[28]</b>political trivia buffs</label> . </p>
<p>`` But it did n't matter , '' <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3"><b>[29]</b>Gans</label> said , in a race that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E10"><b>[30]</b>the incumbent</label> won by more than 8 million popular votes and by a 379-159 advantage in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E47"><b>[31]</b>the all-important Electoral College</label> . </p>
<p>In the 1960 election <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E16"><b>[32]</b>John F. Kennedy</label> had the electoral vote edge and a 114,673-vote margin in the popular vote over <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E17"><b>[33]</b>Richard Nixon</label> . </p>
<p>A total of 68.8 million votes were cast for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18"><b>[34]</b>president</label> . </p>
<p>Eight years later <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E17"><b>[35]</b>Nixon</label> won <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E19"><b>[36]</b>the Electoral College</label> and a popular-vote margin of 510,645 out of 73.2 million votes cast for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18"><b>[37]</b>president</label> . </p>
<p>The 2000 election , of course , will be remembered as the first in 112 years in which <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E20"><b>[38]</b>the leader in the popular vote</label> lost <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18"><b>[39]</b>the White House</label> because <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E22"><b>[40]</b>his opponent</label> prevailed in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E21"><b>[41]</b>the Electoral College</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[42]</b>Bush</label> got 271 electoral votes , one more than <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[43]</b>he</label> needed for a majority and five more than <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[44]</b>Gore , who lost one vote in the Electoral College when a Washington , D.C. , elector left her ballot blank to protest the District of Columbia 's lack of voting power in Congress</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[45]</b>Gore</label> won <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1"><b>[46]</b>New York state</label> , 4,107,697-2,403,374 , or by some 1.7 million votes . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27"><b>[47]</b>Lee Daghlian</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27"><b>[48]</b>the chief spokesman for the state 's Board of Elections</label> , said Friday that about 360,000 <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30"><b>[49]</b>absentee</label> ballots were requested , and that about 260,000 were returned in time to be counted . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1"><b>[50]</b>New York</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30"><b>[51]</b>absentee</label> ballots must be postmarked no later than the day before the election and received no later than a week after the election . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27"><b>[52]</b>Daghlian</label> said <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30"><b>[53]</b>absentee</label> balloting was about 20 percent higher this year than in 1996 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27"><b>[54]</b>He</label> speculated that the presence of <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E31"><b>[55]</b>Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut</label> on <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E34"><b>[56]</b>the Democratic ticket</label> might have caused <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E36"><b>[57]</b>more American Jews</label> to mail ballots from <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E38"><b>[58]</b>Israel</label> . </p>
<p>It was clear on Election Night that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[59]</b>Gore</label> had carried <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42"><b>[60]</b>California</label> in a landslide , so it was expected that the nearly 1.5 million <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[61]</b>absentee</label> ballots that arrived in time to be accepted would sharply augment <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[62]</b>his</label> victory _ and they did . </p>
<p>The final certified totals in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42"><b>[63]</b>California</label> were 5,861,203 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48"><b>[64]</b>Gore</label> and 4,567,429 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50"><b>[65]</b>Bush</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E39"><b>[66]</b>Alfie Charles</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E39"><b>[67]</b>a spokesman for the California secretary of state , Bill Jones</label> , said the percentage of <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42"><b>[68]</b>Californians</label> voting by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[69]</b>absentee</label> ballot has been increasing , and that about <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E44"><b>[70]</b>one-quarter</label> do now . </p>
<p>( <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42"><b>[71]</b>Californians , unlike people in some states</label> , can vote <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8"><b>[72]</b>absentee</label> without showing a compelling reason . </p>
