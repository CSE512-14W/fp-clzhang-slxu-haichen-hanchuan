<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E23">WASHINGTON</label> _ <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Vice President Al Gore</label> 0027s nationwide lead in the popular vote has grown by about 200,000 , to more than half a million , since Dec. 18 , when <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E15">the Electoral College</label> sealed <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">his</label> fate and made <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">Gov. George W. Bush</label> <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">the 43rd president of the United States</label> . </p>
<p>A <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E54">state-by-state</label> survey by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E56">The Associated Press</label> of the final certified results put <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> 0027s popular-vote edge at 539,947 , up considerably from the lead of about 337,000 that was widely reported in the first several weeks after the election . </p>
<p>The totals were 50,996,116 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> and 50,456,169 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">Bush</label> . </p>
<p>Much of the increase came in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42">California</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1">New York</label> , and <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E2">other , smaller states that went for Gore</label> , said <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3">Curtis B. Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate , a nonpartisan research group that has followed presidential elections for a quarter-century</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E6">Election officials in California and New York</label> said Friday that the bigger numbers for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> were not hard to explain . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> carried <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E7">both big states</label> easily . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E7">Both states</label> had big <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">absentee-ballot</label> totals that could not be counted immediately and , because <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">absentee</label> votes generally do not vary sharply from Election Night returns , it was predictable that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">the absentees</label> would widen <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">the vice president</label> 0027s lead . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3">Gans</label> said that in 1996 , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E10">President Clinton</label> 0027s lead over <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E12">Bob Dole</label> grew by some 200,000 votes from election night until all <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">absentee</label> ballots were counted and all the votes certified , a fact all but forgotten except by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E14">political trivia buffs</label> . </p>
<p>`` But it did n0027t matter , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E3">Gans</label> said , in a race that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E10">the incumbent</label> won by more than 8 million popular votes and by a 379-159 advantage in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E47">the all-important Electoral College</label> . </p>
<p>In the 1960 election <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E16">John F. Kennedy</label> had the electoral vote edge and a 114,673-vote margin in the popular vote over <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E17">Richard Nixon</label> . </p>
<p>A total of 68.8 million votes were cast for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18">president</label> . </p>
<p>Eight years later <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E17">Nixon</label> won <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E19">the Electoral College</label> and a popular-vote margin of 510,645 out of 73.2 million votes cast for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18">president</label> . </p>
<p>The 2000 election , of course , will be remembered as the first in 112 years in which <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E20">the leader in the popular vote</label> lost <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E18">the White House</label> because <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E22">his opponent</label> prevailed in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E21">the Electoral College</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">Bush</label> got 271 electoral votes , one more than <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">he</label> needed for a majority and five more than <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore , who lost one vote in the Electoral College when a Washington , D.C. , elector left her ballot blank to protest the District of Columbia 0027s lack of voting power in Congress</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> won <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1">New York state</label> , 4,107,697-2,403,374 , or by some 1.7 million votes . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27">Lee Daghlian</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27">the chief spokesman for the state 0027s Board of Elections</label> , said Friday that about 360,000 <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30">absentee</label> ballots were requested , and that about 260,000 were returned in time to be counted . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E1">New York</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30">absentee</label> ballots must be postmarked no later than the day before the election and received no later than a week after the election . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27">Daghlian</label> said <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E30">absentee</label> balloting was about 20 percent higher this year than in 1996 . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E27">He</label> speculated that the presence of <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E31">Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut</label> on <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E34">the Democratic ticket</label> might have caused <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E36">more American Jews</label> to mail ballots from <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E38">Israel</label> . </p>
<p>It was clear on Election Night that <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> had carried <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42">California</label> in a landslide , so it was expected that the nearly 1.5 million <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">absentee</label> ballots that arrived in time to be accepted would sharply augment <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">his</label> victory _ and they did . </p>
<p>The final certified totals in <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42">California</label> were 5,861,203 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E48">Gore</label> and 4,567,429 for <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E50">Bush</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E39">Alfie Charles</label> , <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E39">a spokesman for the California secretary of state , Bill Jones</label> , said the percentage of <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E42">Californians</label> voting by <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E8">absentee</label> ballot has been increasing , and that about <label class="NYT20001229.2047.0291-E44">one-quarter</label> do now . </p>
