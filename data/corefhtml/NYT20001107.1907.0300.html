<p><label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E18"><b>[0]</b>NEW YORK</label> _ Never mind those points of light <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E27"><b>[1]</b>a former president</label> talked about . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[2]</b>A research company</label> is proposing that `` points of presence '' are what matter , at least when it comes to online marketing . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[3]</b>The company</label> , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[4]</b>Word of Net</label> , is introducing a system meant to measure the various points at which <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E30"><b>[5]</b>computer users</label> are exposed to Web sites , wherever those exposures may occur . </p>
<p>The measurement system , called the visibility index , is intended to provide information beyond the tracking of traffic to a site by tracking the exposure to sites through search engines , keyword inquiries , listings , links from other sites and category listings in online directories . </p>
<p>The goal of the index is to help <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E31"><b>[6]</b>advertisers</label> increase <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E31"><b>[7]</b>their</label> visibility online by spending more effectively when buying banners and other types of interactive advertisements to generate traffic . </p>
<p>That has become particularly important since the dot-com shake-out began and advertisement dollars have grown increasingly scarce . </p>
<p>`` This is a key marketing competitive-intelligence tool because it highlights exposure all over the Internet , '' said <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E32"><b>[8]</b>Astrid van Dorst</label> , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E32"><b>[9]</b>senior analyst for the e-marketing intelligence group at the Gartner Group in San Jose , Calif.</label> , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E32"><b>[14]</b>who</label> was briefed about the index by <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[15]</b>Word of Net</label> before its public introduction . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E1"><b>[16]</b>You</label> will see more of this as Internet metrics reaches the next level of maturity , '' <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E32"><b>[17]</b>she</label> added . </p>
<p>The index data are presented as scores , which are weighted . </p>
<p>The higher the score on the index , the more points of presence for a site and thus the more visible it is to consumers . </p>
<p>The Web site ranked first in the initial visibility index , with a score of 973 , is www . </p>
<p>aol . </p>
<p>com , from <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E2"><b>[18]</b>America Online</label> . </p>
<p>The rest of the top five are www . </p>
<p>zdnet . </p>
<p>com , from <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E3"><b>[19]</b>CNet</label> , with a score of 936 ; http://members.aol.com , also from <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E2"><b>[20]</b>America Online</label> , 925 ; www . </p>

<p>com , from <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E5"><b>[22]</b>the Walt Disney Co.</label> , 915 . </p>
<p>`` The real value of <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[23]</b>our</label> technology is that it provides a way to measure return on investment for <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E6"><b>[24]</b>your</label> marketing campaigns , '' said <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E7"><b>[25]</b>Eric Sanders</label> , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E7"><b>[26]</b>chief executive at Word of Net in Sherman Oaks , Calif.</label> `` Online advertising is a $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion industry , and it 's not nearly accountable enough , '' <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E7"><b>[30]</b>he</label> added . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E6"><b>[31]</b>You</label> can use <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[32]</b>our</label> data to determine which of <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E6"><b>[33]</b>your</label> marketing spends generate sales . </p>
<p>'' The index is also intended to enable <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E31"><b>[34]</b>advertisers</label> to monitor how pervasive the mentions of Web sites operated by <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E10"><b>[35]</b>rivals</label> may be in cyberspace . </p>
<p>`` This is helpful because it gives <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E6"><b>[36]</b>you</label> a sense of how <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E6"><b>[37]</b>you</label> come up against <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E11"><b>[39]</b>your competitors</label> , '' said <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[40]</b>Michele Chaboudy</label> , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[41]</b>vice president for marketing at MarketWatch .</label> </p>

<p>'' <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[50]</b>Chaboudy</label> described herself as `` pretty skeptical '' about new measurements `` because <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[51]</b>I</label> 've seen a lot of them . </p>
<p>'' But data that <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E28"><b>[52]</b>Word of Net</label> has shared with <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[53]</b>her</label> so far led to a decision `` to look at some places <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E14"><b>[54]</b>we</label> might want to advertise , '' where <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E14"><b>[55]</b>MarketWatch .</label> </p>
<p>com is not advertising now , <label class="NYT20001107.1907.0300-E12"><b>[56]</b>she</label> added . </p>
