<p>'' <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E34"><b>[19]</b>Levitt</label> and <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E28"><b>[20]</b>the SEC</label> are requiring <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E1"><b>[21]</b>companies</label> to disclose material information to <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E2"><b>[22]</b>the public</label> at the same time that <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E1"><b>[23]</b>they</label> tell <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E3"><b>[24]</b>analysts</label> and <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E4"><b>[25]</b>institutional investors</label> . </p>
<p>The new measure , Regulation FD , is set to take effect later this month . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E31"><b>[26]</b>Phillips</label> said that <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E28"><b>[27]</b>the SEC</label> had not applied similar rules to <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E5"><b>[28]</b>the $ 7 trillion mutual fund industry</label> and that <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E28"><b>[29]</b>the SEC</label> should press <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E5"><b>[30]</b>the industry</label> to disclose more frequently which stocks funds hold . </p>
<p>Under current regulations , mutual funds are required to disclose their full holdings to <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E28"><b>[31]</b>the SEC</label> twice a year . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E31"><b>[32]</b>Phillips</label> thinks portfolios should be disclosed monthly , 90 days after the end of each month . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[33]</b>Paul F. Roye</label> , <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[34]</b>the director of the SEC 's division of investment management</label> , said <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[37]</b>he</label> `` had to do a bit of an Al Gore '' and defend <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E9"><b>[39]</b>his boss</label> ' record . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E34"><b>[40]</b>The chairman</label> is committed to protecting <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E10"><b>[41]</b>investors</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[42]</b>he</label> said , adding that it was `` an overstatement '' to say that <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E10"><b>[43]</b>all investors</label> wanted more frequent disclosure of mutual fund portfolios . </p>
<p>`` There 's <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E11"><b>[44]</b>a group of investors that want more information</label> , and there 's also <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E12"><b>[47]</b>a group of investors who say they are inundated with information</label> , '' <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[51]</b>Roye</label> said . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[52]</b>Roye</label> suggested that large , closely watched funds like <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E13"><b>[53]</b>Fidelity</label> 's $ 104 billion flagship Magellan fund might have difficulty trading in and out of positions with too frequent disclosure and that funds like <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E13"><b>[54]</b>Fidelity</label> 's $ 104 billion flagship Magellan fund might have difficulty trading in and out of positions with too frequent disclosure and that there were higher priorities like making fund prospectuses easier to read and toughening regulation of schemes to manipulate funds before they report their quarterly performance figures . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E6"><b>[55]</b>Roye</label> also said that <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E8"><b>[57]</b>his division</label> would propose a rule requiring mutual funds to have 80 percent of their portfolios invested in the style , asset class or region indicated by the name of the fund , so that a <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E14"><b>[58]</b>European</label> investment fund , for example , would have to be 80 percent invested in <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E14"><b>[59]</b>Europe</label> . </p>
<p>The current requirement is 65 percent . </p>
<p>The panel discussion , whose focus was on the disclosure issue , was sponsored by <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E17"><b>[60]</b>Fund Democracy</label> , <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E17"><b>[62]</b>a fund shareholder advocacy group founded by Mercer Bullard , a former lawyer for the SEC 's enforcement division</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E31"><b>[67]</b>Phillips</label> and <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E22"><b>[68]</b>Harold R. Evensky</label> , <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E22"><b>[69]</b>a financial planner</label> , repeatedly criticized <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E28"><b>[70]</b>the SEC</label> 's emphasis on simplification over portfolio disclosure . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E24"><b>[71]</b>You</label> need to make the information available , '' <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E22"><b>[72]</b>Evensky</label> said . </p>
<p>`` Can <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E24"><b>[73]</b>you</label> imagine <label class="NYT20001012.1539.0165-E25"><b>[74]</b>a corporation</label> just issuing a simple prospectus because the financials are too complicated ? </p>
