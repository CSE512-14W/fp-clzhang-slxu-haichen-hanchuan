<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E22">Analysts</label> said that despite offering free electronic service , in contrast to <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4">TiVo</label> 0027s subscription service , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37">ReplayTV</label> has trailed in the <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E36">consumer</label> market . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4">TiVo</label> 0027s digital recorders are being manufactured by <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E24">Sony</label> and <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E23">Phillips</label> , while <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37">ReplayTV</label> systems are being shipped by <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E25">Panasonic</label> . </p>
