<p>Along with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[8]</b>TiVo Inc.</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[9]</b>a competing Silicon Valley startup company</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[10]</b>Replay</label> has been trying to build a market for computer-based systems that replace traditional videotape recorders and permit <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E7"><b>[11]</b>television viewers</label> to freeze programs and rewind , and to create custom `` channels . </p>
<p>'' As part of <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[12]</b>its</label> shift in strategy , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E8"><b>[13]</b>Replay 's founder</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E8"><b>[14]</b>Anthony Wood</label> , will become <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E8"><b>[15]</b>the company 's new chief executive</label> , replacing <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E1"><b>[16]</b>Kim LeMaster</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[17]</b>The company</label> also said <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[18]</b>it</label> will try to refocus <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[19]</b>its</label> business on software licensing arrangements made with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E11"><b>[20]</b>partners , including cable service providers and makers of cable set-top boxes</label> . </p>
<p>`` The new business model is focused more intently on <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E14"><b>[21]</b>the cable industry</label> , '' said <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E15"><b>[22]</b>Steve Shannon</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E15"><b>[23]</b>Replay 's vice president of marketing</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E15"><b>[24]</b>He</label> said <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[25]</b>the company</label> was in trials with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E17"><b>[26]</b>Time Warner</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E18"><b>[27]</b>Comcast</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E19"><b>[28]</b>Charter Communications</label> and with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E20"><b>[29]</b>AT&AMP ; T.</label> <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[30]</b>It</label> also has announced a development agreement with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E21"><b>[31]</b>the Motorola Corp.</label> to build <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[32]</b>its</label> software into a new generation of cable set-top boxes . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E22"><b>[33]</b>Analysts</label> said that despite offering free electronic service , in contrast to <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[34]</b>TiVo</label> 's subscription service , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[35]</b>ReplayTV</label> has trailed in the <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E36"><b>[36]</b>consumer</label> market . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[37]</b>TiVo</label> 's digital recorders are being manufactured by <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E24"><b>[38]</b>Sony</label> and <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E23"><b>[39]</b>Phillips</label> , while <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[40]</b>ReplayTV</label> systems are being shipped by <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E25"><b>[41]</b>Panasonic</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[42]</b>The company , which is based in Mountain View , Calif.</label> , said that <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[43]</b>it</label> has so far sold approximately 20,000 units . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[44]</b>TiVo</label> has had the ` wow ' factor , '' said <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E29"><b>[45]</b>Josh Bernoff</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E29"><b>[46]</b>an industry analyst at Forrester Research , a computer industry research and consulting firm</label> . </p>
<p>`` The result is that <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[47]</b>Replay</label> has been left with a weakening market position and a device that works well but does n't look as great . </p>
<p>'' However , that disadvantage will work to <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E37"><b>[48]</b>ReplayTV</label> 's advantage in striking deals with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E14"><b>[49]</b>the cable industry</label> , <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E29"><b>[50]</b>he</label> added . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E4"><b>[51]</b>TiVo</label> has had difficulty building alliances with <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E34"><b>[52]</b>cable companies , who are not generally interested in showcasing competing brands</label> . </p>
<p>On the horizon is <label class="NYT20001127.2214.0372-E35"><b>[53]</b>Microsoft , which has also recently entered the market for personal video recorders with its own system , called Ultimate TV</label> . </p>
