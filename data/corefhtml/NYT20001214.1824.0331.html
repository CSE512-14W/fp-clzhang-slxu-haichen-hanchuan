<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[0]</b>Jeff Zucker</label> , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[1]</b>the longtime executive producer of NBC 's `` Today '' program</label> , will be named Friday as <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[2]</b>the new president of NBC 's entertainment division , replacing Garth Ancier</label> , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E9"><b>[3]</b>NBC executives</label> said . </p>
<p>The move will have a ripple effect on <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E5"><b>[4]</b>two NBC divisions</label> , forcing <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[5]</b>the network</label> to replace <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[6]</b>Zucker at `` Today , '' where he has led the program to its most dominant ratings position in decades</label> , and shaking up <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[7]</b>the entertainment division , where Zucker has never worked</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[8]</b>Zucker</label> 's enormous success at `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7"><b>[9]</b>Today , '' where he has served as executive producer since 1994</label> , has for several years set <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[10]</b>him</label> up for a promotion at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[11]</b>the network</label> , and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[12]</b>he</label> has frequently expressed <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[13]</b>his</label> desire to move on from `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7"><b>[14]</b>Today</label> . </p>
<p>'' On Tuesday night , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[15]</b>Zucker</label> said that after covering the postelection news on `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7"><b>[16]</b>Today</label> '' and seeing that story help establish the third hour of the program , which was only added in October , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[17]</b>he</label> had little left to accomplish at `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7"><b>[18]</b>Today</label> . </p>
<p>'' But no job in <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E11"><b>[19]</b>the news division</label> had either been available or of interest to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[20]</b>Zucker</label> . </p>
<p>The move to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[21]</b>NBC Entertainment</label> serves as the best way for <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[22]</b>NBC</label> to retain <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2"><b>[23]</b>an executive they regard as one of the best in television</label> . </p>
<p>The decision abruptly ends <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[24]</b>Ancier</label> 's leadership of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[25]</b>NBC Entertainment</label> after only 18 months . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[26]</b>His</label> tenure became extremely troubled this fall after the new lineup of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[27]</b>NBC</label> series stumbled badly . </p>
<p>But the move 's timing is still somewhat surprising because <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[28]</b>NBC</label> had enough strength among <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[29]</b>its</label> core group of hit shows to win last month 's ratings sweep competition . </p>
<p>In addition , three series _ `` The West Wing , '' `` Law and Order S.V.U. '' and `` Third Watch '' _ all added last fall , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[30]</b>Ancier</label> 's first at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[31]</b>NBC</label> , have since become significant hits for <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[32]</b>the network</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[33]</b>Ancier</label> 's ouster had been the subject of widespread rumors in <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E15"><b>[34]</b>Hollywood</label> in the last several weeks , largely because of the failure of this fall 's slate of programs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[35]</b>NBC</label> has several aging hits , including `` Frasier '' and `` Friends , '' that may not have many more years on <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[36]</b>the network</label> , and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E9"><b>[37]</b>NBC executives</label> have said this fall that it was especially crucial <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[38]</b>the network</label> add some new replacements . </p>
<p>Only one <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[39]</b>NBC</label> show , `` Ed , '' has performed with any particular promise , although two others , `` DAG ' and `` Cursed , '' have proved at least serviceable in time periods where they are protected by other <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[40]</b>NBC</label> hits . </p>
<p>But many other new <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[41]</b>NBC</label> series this fall collapsed quickly , including two high-profile shows , `` The Michael Richards Show '' and `` Titans . </p>
<p>'' <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[42]</b>Ancier</label> was especially tied to the latter , having argued strenuously for it last spring before <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[43]</b>NBC</label> selected <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[44]</b>its</label> schedule . </p>
<p>The show had been opposed by <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E16"><b>[45]</b>several other senior NBC executives , including the network president , Bob Wright</label> , on grounds that it was tasteless . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[46]</b>Ancier</label> had dismissed that criticism . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[47]</b>Ancier</label> was also the target of some criticism from <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E17"><b>[48]</b>Wright</label> last year after <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E19"><b>[49]</b>CBS , with `` Survivor</label> , '' and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E20"><b>[50]</b>ABC , with `` Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</label> , '' turned <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E21"><b>[51]</b>their networks</label> around with so-called reality programs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E17"><b>[52]</b>Wright</label> questioned why <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[53]</b>NBC Entertainment</label> was <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[54]</b>the only network that had not picked up programs in the reality genre</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[55]</b>Ancier</label> had come to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27"><b>[56]</b>NBC</label> with seemingly ideal qualifications . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4"><b>[57]</b>He</label> had previously worked at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1"><b>[58]</b>NBC Entertainment</label> , then had run <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E22"><b>[59]</b>Fox</label> 's programming in the first days of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E22"><b>[60]</b>that network</label> and most recently had managed programming at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23"><b>[61]</b>the WB Network</label> , helping <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23"><b>[62]</b>that network</label> establish <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23"><b>[63]</b>itself</label> as <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23"><b>[64]</b>a strong competitor for young audiences</label> . </p>
