<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">Jeff Zucker</label> , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">the longtime executive producer of NBC 0027s `` Today 00270027 program</label> , will be named Friday as <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">the new president of NBC 0027s entertainment division , replacing Garth Ancier</label> , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E9">NBC executives</label> said . </p>
<p>The move will have a ripple effect on <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E5">two NBC divisions</label> , forcing <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">the network</label> to replace <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">Zucker at `` Today , 00270027 where he has led the program to its most dominant ratings position in decades</label> , and shaking up <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">the entertainment division , where Zucker has never worked</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">Zucker</label> 0027s enormous success at `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7">Today , 00270027 where he has served as executive producer since 1994</label> , has for several years set <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">him</label> up for a promotion at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">the network</label> , and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">he</label> has frequently expressed <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">his</label> desire to move on from `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7">Today</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 On Tuesday night , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">Zucker</label> said that after covering the postelection news on `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7">Today</label> 00270027 and seeing that story help establish the third hour of the program , which was only added in October , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">he</label> had little left to accomplish at `` <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E7">Today</label> . </p>
<p>00270027 But no job in <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E11">the news division</label> had either been available or of interest to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">Zucker</label> . </p>
<p>The move to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">NBC Entertainment</label> serves as the best way for <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> to retain <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E2">an executive they regard as one of the best in television</label> . </p>
<p>The decision abruptly ends <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> 0027s leadership of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">NBC Entertainment</label> after only 18 months . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">His</label> tenure became extremely troubled this fall after the new lineup of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> series stumbled badly . </p>
<p>But the move 0027s timing is still somewhat surprising because <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> had enough strength among <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">its</label> core group of hit shows to win last month 0027s ratings sweep competition . </p>
<p>In addition , three series _ `` The West Wing , 00270027 `` Law and Order S.V.U. 00270027 and `` Third Watch 00270027 _ all added last fall , <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> 0027s first at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> , have since become significant hits for <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">the network</label> . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> 0027s ouster had been the subject of widespread rumors in <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E15">Hollywood</label> in the last several weeks , largely because of the failure of this fall 0027s slate of programs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> has several aging hits , including `` Frasier 00270027 and `` Friends , 00270027 that may not have many more years on <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">the network</label> , and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E9">NBC executives</label> have said this fall that it was especially crucial <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">the network</label> add some new replacements . </p>
<p>Only one <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> show , `` Ed , 00270027 has performed with any particular promise , although two others , `` DAG 0027 and `` Cursed , 00270027 have proved at least serviceable in time periods where they are protected by other <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> hits . </p>
<p>But many other new <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> series this fall collapsed quickly , including two high-profile shows , `` The Michael Richards Show 00270027 and `` Titans . </p>
<p>00270027 <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> was especially tied to the latter , having argued strenuously for it last spring before <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> selected <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">its</label> schedule . </p>
<p>The show had been opposed by <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E16">several other senior NBC executives , including the network president , Bob Wright</label> , on grounds that it was tasteless . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> had dismissed that criticism . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> was also the target of some criticism from <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E17">Wright</label> last year after <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E19">CBS , with `` Survivor</label> , 00270027 and <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E20">ABC , with `` Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</label> , 00270027 turned <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E21">their networks</label> around with so-called reality programs . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E17">Wright</label> questioned why <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">NBC Entertainment</label> was <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">the only network that had not picked up programs in the reality genre</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">Ancier</label> had come to <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E27">NBC</label> with seemingly ideal qualifications . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E4">He</label> had previously worked at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E1">NBC Entertainment</label> , then had run <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E22">Fox</label> 0027s programming in the first days of <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E22">that network</label> and most recently had managed programming at <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23">the WB Network</label> , helping <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23">that network</label> establish <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23">itself</label> as <label class="NYT20001214.1824.0331-E23">a strong competitor for young audiences</label> . </p>
