<p>The <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E76">Democratic</label> strategy calls for <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">Gore</label> to delegate the attacks to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E77">his aides</label> so <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">he</label> can maintain <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">his</label> pledge to remain above the fray . </p>
<p>Indeed , even as <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E77">his aides</label> were finalizing plans for <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E77">their</label> assault , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">Gore</label> discussed <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">his</label> education proposals on Sunday afternoon with <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E1">teachers</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E2">students</label> and <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E3">parents</label> during a photo opportunity at <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E4">his residence in Washington</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">He</label> then flew to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E6">this beach resort near Sarasota</label> for three days of preparation for Wednesday night 0027s debate with <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E9">Winston-Salem , N.C.</label> , the second of their three scheduled encounters . </p>
<p>But <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E11">Gore 0027s surrogates , including his running mate , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , and the Democratic National Committee 0027s national chairman , Joe Andrew</label> , will apparently feel little such restraint . </p>
<p>And <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E18">Gore 0027s press secretary</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E18">Chris Lehane</label> , made it clear in an interview that <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E20">Gore aides</label> do not feel bound by <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">their candidate</label> 0027s pledge . </p>
<p>`` <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">The governor</label> will be held to presidential standards when it comes to describing <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">his</label> policy views , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E18">Lehane</label> said . </p>

<p>00270027 That was a reference to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E22">former Vice President Dan Quayle , who was renowned for his verbal slips while serving under Bush 0027s father</label> . </p>
<p>Similarly , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E26">Mark D. Fabiani</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E26">Gore 0027s deputy campaign manager</label> , told <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E28">CNN</label> 0027s `` Late Edition 00270027 Sunday that <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> `` was incoherent _ <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">he</label> was babbling 00270027 in trying to explain <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">his</label> own tax-cut proposal at a Saturday campaign stop in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E58">Florida</label> . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E29">Gore aides</label> said <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E70">the campaign</label> had long planned to focus attention on <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s record in the four weeks before the Nov. 7 election . </p>
<p>But the timing takes on additional significance because of the continuing closeness of the race after <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E30">the candidates</label> 0027 first debate last week and because of <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E31">the Bush campaign</label> 0027s efforts to label <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">Gore</label> as <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E33">a `` serial exaggerator .</label> </p>

<p>The new <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E68">Gore</label> offensive will include <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E17">Democratic National Committee</label> television advertisements about <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s record on health care and the environment . </p>
<p>Several advertisements tailored to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E37">individual cities and states</label> have started being broadcast in selected markets in recent days . </p>
<p>In <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E38">environmentally conscious Seattle</label> , for instance , one commercial describes the smog in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E39">Houston</label> and implores <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E40">viewers</label> to `` take a deep breath and imagine <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E38">Seattle</label> with <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E41">Texas-style</label> environmental regulation . </p>
<p>00270027 An advertisement being shown in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E42">Iowa</label> compares <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E41">Texas</label> 0027 national standing in health care and in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E43">student</label> test scores with <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E42">Iowa</label> 0027s higher rankings . </p>
<p>In addition , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E12">Lieberman</label> will be dispatched to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E41">Texas</label> for a `` failed leadership tour 00270027 this week , and <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E15">Andrew</label> will hold a news conference on the subject <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E21">here</label> on Monday . </p>
<p><label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E44">Other surrogates , including members of Congress</label> , also will be used , said <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E47">Douglas Hattaway</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E47">a Gore spokesman</label> . </p>

<p><label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E12">Lieberman</label> provided a preview Sunday by faulting <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s environmental and health-care records in an interview on <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E28">CNN</label> . </p>
<p>`` The fact is that <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">George Bush</label> 0027s record on the environment in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E41">Texas</label> is horrible , 00270027 <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E12">he</label> said . </p>

<p>00270027 In addition to drawing attention to <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s record on health care and the environment , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E57">the Gore surrogates</label> are also expected to discuss <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E32">Bush</label> 0027s approval of legislation permitting the carrying of <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E59">concealed weapons</label> in <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E60">churches</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E61">hospitals</label> and <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E62">nursing homes</label> , <label class="NYT20001008.2100.0120-E63">Gore aides</label> said . </p>
