\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we present \sys, a toolkit for crowd-sourced NLP annotation. We visualize two important categories of NLP problems: clustering and parsing. By providing simplified operators and interactive interface, we allow crowd-sourced workers to generate high quality training data for NLP problem. In our evaluation, we let non-expert student to test our toolkit. The results are very promising. Because of the time limitation, we have not yet let the crowd sourced workers to really test our toolkit. In future, we would deploy the toolkit on AMT to collect real training data for NLP problems.
