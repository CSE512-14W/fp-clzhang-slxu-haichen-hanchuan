\section{Evaluation methods}

We are going to do separate evaluations of the two targeted 
labeling tasks. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Tree building. There are a lot of tree builiding tasks in the
NLP area. We propose to evaluate our system using the task of semantic
tree parsing of sentences. The goal of the task is to get the semantic
parsing tree of each labeling sentence. 

\textit{Participants}: We propose to gather 4 to 10 participants from
undergraduate/graduate UW students.  

\textit{Evaluation process}: Each participant is given 2 sets of
randomly selected sentences.  In each set, there may be around 100
sentences. All the participants are divided into two groups.  Half of
the participants will be asked to complete the parsing of the first
given sentence set using only plain text file editors, plain html
files or Microsoft Excel files without diagrams. They are then
required to complete the second setence set with the aid of our tool.
The other half of the participants will be asked to complete the
labeling tasks in the reverse order. The purpose of the two group
splitting and the different order of conducting the labeling is to
eliminate the possible factor of gaining unexpected information from
using the first labeling tool.

\textit{Evaluation}: Both time consumption and result quality of the two
groups of participants will be evaluated.

\item Clustering building. In order to evaluate the clustering
building task, we propose to use entity clustering in NLP relation
extraction. The goal of the task is to get a cluster structure of
given entities.

\textit{Participants}: We propose to also gather 4 to 10 participants from
UW undergraduate/graduate students.

\textit{Evaluation process}: Each participant is given 2 sets of
randomly selected entities, e.g. human names, together with extra
context info for entity resolution. The participants are also divided
into two groups as in the tree building task. And also the two groups label the
entities in the same way as in tree building task.

\textit{Evaluation}: Both time consumption and result quality of the
two groups of participants will be evaluated.
