\section{Clustering Annotation}

Clustering task usually consists of tens or hundreds of targeted tokens that need to be clustered together. 

\subsection{View}

The entire window is separated into two parts. The left part (about 40\%) is used to display the document(s). We highlight all the targeted tokens with a grey background and white texts to make them more obvious and easier to notice. The right partition (about 60\%) is the operation area where user group related tokens together. Supporting operation will be introduced in next subsection. Each token has a corresponding node in the operation area. To bridge the connection between the text display and graphic chart, we label each token and its corresponding node with an index.
